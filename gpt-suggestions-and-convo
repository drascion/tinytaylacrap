can you help me make a fantasy rpg in godot
I'd be happy to help you make a fantasy RPG in Godot! Godot is a powerful, open-source game engine that can be used to create a wide variety of games. It has a simple, intuitive interface and a large community of developers who are willing to help and share their knowledge.

To get started, you will need to download and install the Godot game engine. You can find instructions on how to do this on the Godot website (https://godotengine.org/).

Once you have Godot installed, you can start by creating a new project. You can do this by clicking the "New Project" button in the welcome screen. This will bring up a dialog where you can select a location for your project and choose a template.

For a fantasy RPG, you will probably want to use the "2D" template. This template includes all of the basic tools and resources you need to create a 2D game, including a sprite editor, a tilemap editor, and a physics engine.

After you have created your project, you can start building your game by adding assets (such as sprites and tiles) and creating scenes (which represent different levels or areas in your game). You can use the various editors and tools in Godot to design and lay out your levels, and you can use the built-in scripting system (GDScript) to create gameplay mechanics and logic.

There are many tutorials and resources available online to help you learn how to use Godot and create a game. I recommend starting with the official Godot documentation (https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/) and looking for tutorials on YouTube and other websites. With a little bit of effort and persistence, you should be able to create a fun and exciting fantasy RPG using Godot!

are platformer rpgs good?
Platformer RPGs, also known as action RPGs, are a type of role-playing game that combines elements of platformer games (games that involve jumping and navigating through levels) with elements of RPGs (games that involve character progression and leveling up). These types of games can be a lot of fun to play, as they offer a mix of fast-paced action and character development.

Some popular examples of platformer RPGs include games like "Cave Story," "Hades," and "Ori and the Blind Forest." These games have received critical acclaim for their engaging gameplay and compelling storylines.

Overall, whether or not platformer RPGs are "good" depends on personal preference. Some players may enjoy the fast-paced action and challenging gameplay of these types of games, while others may prefer more traditional RPGs with slower-paced combat and more emphasis on character progression and story. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not you enjoy playing platformer RPGs.

i think side scrolling but not platformer
If you're interested in creating a side-scrolling RPG (a role-playing game that involves scrolling the screen from left to right or right to left), there are a few different approaches you can take. One option is to use a game engine like Godot, which I mentioned in my previous message, and create your game using 2D graphics and tools. This will allow you to create a game with characters, enemies, and environments that move horizontally across the screen as the player progresses through the levels.

Alternatively, you could create a side-scrolling RPG using a tool like RPG Maker. RPG Maker is a software package that allows you to create role-playing games without requiring any programming knowledge. It includes a range of pre-made assets and features that you can use to create your game, including side-scrolling maps and character sprites.

Regardless of which approach you choose, the process of creating a side-scrolling RPG will generally involve designing and creating your game's assets (such as characters, enemies, and backgrounds), creating levels or maps, and implementing gameplay mechanics and story elements using programming or visual scripting tools. With a little bit of effort and persistence, you should be able to create a fun and engaging side-scrolling RPG!

how do I create original fantasy creatrures that don't use magic
Creating original fantasy creatures that don't use magic can be a fun and challenging task. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

Start by thinking about the role that the creature will play in your world. Do you want it to be a predator, prey, or something else? How will it fit into the ecosystem of your world?

Consider the creature's physical characteristics. What does it look like? What materials is it made of? What kinds of adaptations does it have that help it survive in its environment?

Think about the creature's behavior and personality. How does it interact with other creatures in its environment? Does it have any unique social habits or behaviors?

Consider the creature's backstory and history. How did it evolve or come to be in your world? What cultural significance does it have in your world's mythology or lore?

By answering these questions and using your imagination, you should be able to come up with some interesting and original fantasy creatures that don't rely on magic. Good luck!

how many sentient, intelligent species should there be?
There is no set number of sentient, intelligent species that should be included in a fantasy world. The number and diversity of intelligent species can vary greatly depending on the needs and vision of the creator.

In some fantasy worlds, there may be just a few intelligent species, while in others there may be many. The number of intelligent species can depend on factors such as the size and complexity of the world, the role that each species plays in the ecosystem and society, and the overall tone and themes of the story.

Ultimately, the number of intelligent species in a fantasy world is up to the creator and should be based on what works best for the story and setting they are trying to create.

could you think of a background for the game (this game will have no magic, modern technology, and redikes, who are semi-tribal reptillian humanoids, along with humans, and dragons who obsess over everything, and other species)
Certainly! Here is a possible background for your game:

In the beginning, there were only a few intelligent species on the planet: humans, redikes, and dragons. The humans lived in small villages and towns scattered across the land, relying on their wits and resourcefulness to survive. The redikes were a semi-tribal reptilian humanoid species that lived in the deep forests and mountains, hunting and gathering to sustain themselves. The dragons were a mysterious and powerful species that lived in seclusion, obsessing over everything they encountered.

Over time, these species interacted and influenced one another, leading to the development of complex societies and cultures. The humans learned to farm and trade, building larger cities and empires. The redikes formed clans and tribes, honing their skills as hunters and warriors. The dragons turned their obsessions into art and science, creating remarkable inventions and discoveries.

Despite their differences, the intelligent species coexisted peacefully, respecting one another's way of life. However, as the populations of each species grew, so did their needs and desires. This led to conflict, as each species fought for resources and territory. The world was plunged into darkness, as wars and struggles tore apart the once harmonious societies.

As the intelligent species waged war on one another, they also faced other challenges. Strange creatures and beasts emerged from the depths of the earth, threatening to destroy everything in their path. Natural disasters and environmental changes also took their toll, forcing the intelligent species to adapt and survive.

In this harsh and dangerous world, the intelligent species must work together and overcome their differences if they hope to survive and thrive. Can they set aside their differences and unite against the common threats facing them, or will they continue to fight and destroy one another? The fate of the world rests in their hands.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like that, in fact, i even thought of one of the species that they would encounter, the scourge, known be the redikes as yendel, it is a fast, all black, quadruped that is an efficient hunter with little to no empathy because of its unforgiving home hidden underground
That sounds like an interesting and formidable species to include in your game! The scourge, or yendel as they are known to the redikes, could add a new level of danger and challenge for the intelligent species as they try to survive and thrive in this harsh and dangerous world.

You could also consider how the scourge fits into the larger ecosystem and mythology of your world. How did they come to be? What is their relationship with the other intelligent species? Do they have their own society and culture, or are they solitary creatures? These are all questions that can help you develop the scourge as a fully realized and integrated part of your game world.

I hope these ideas are helpful and that they inspire you as you continue to develop your game. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
I think the scourge should be solitary for the most part but have a simple culture with each other, and maybe they should have some sort of symbiotic relationship with another species, or even keep pets, they should also have a related species that is white and more peaceful and live on the surface called the whitedog, or yenda.
Those are interesting ideas for the scourge and their relationship to other species in your game world! The idea of the scourge being solitary but having a simple culture with one another, as well as possibly having a symbiotic relationship with another species or even keeping pets, could add depth and complexity to their society and way of life.

The addition of the whitedog, or yenda, as a related species that is white and more peaceful, living on the surface, could also provide an interesting contrast to the scourge. It could be interesting to explore the differences and similarities between the two species, and how they coexist or interact with one another.

I hope these ideas are helpful and that they inspire you as you continue to develop your game world. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i also think that there should be a greydog, a neutral hybrid species that doesn't attack unless scared, that makes a good pet or servant.
The addition of a greydog, a neutral hybrid species that doesn't attack unless scared, could add an interesting dynamic to your game world. This species could potentially be used as a pet or servant by the other intelligent species, and their neutral nature could make them valuable as intermediaries or mediators in conflicts between different groups.

You could also consider how the greydog fits into the larger ecosystem and mythology of your world. How did they come to be? What is their relationship with the other intelligent species and the scourge? Do they have their own society and culture, or are they more solitary?

By answering these questions and developing the greydog as a fully realized and integrated part of your game world, you can create a rich and immersive experience for your players. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what other original intelligent species should there be?

By including a diverse range of intelligent species in your game world, you can create a rich and immersive experience for your players. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what are some ideas for original species that could be pets and livestock?
There are many possibilities for original species that could be used as pets or livestock in your game world. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

Fuzzies: A species of small, fluffy creatures that are affectionate and loyal. They could make good companions and be kept as pets, and could also be used for their soft fur.

Scamperers: A species of fast, agile creatures that are known for their intelligence and curiosity. They could be trained to perform tricks and tasks, and could also be used as messenger animals or guards.

Puffers: A species of spherical creatures that are able to inflate and deflate their bodies. They could be kept as pets for their cute and amusing appearance, and could also be used as living cushions or pillows.

Slinkers: A species of snake-like creatures that are prized for their skins and venom. They could be kept as exotic pets, and their venom could be harvested for medicinal or other purposes.

Flutterbees: A species of intelligent, winged insects that are known for their ability to pollinate flowers and produce honey. They could be kept as pets or used for their honey, and could also be used to pollinate crops.

By including a diverse range of species that can be kept as pets or used as livestock, you can add depth and variety to your game world. Good luck!

what technology should the redikes dragons humans and maybe greydogs use
The technology used by the redikes, dragons, humans, and greydogs in your game world will depend on the level of technological development that you envision for each species. Here are a few ideas for the types of technology that these species could use:

Redikes: The redikes could use technology that is based on their natural abilities and resources. They could have weapons and tools made from stone or wood, and could use their hunting and tracking skills to survive in the wild. They could also use simple machines, such as levers and pulleys, to help them with tasks like lifting heavy objects or building structures.

Dragons: The dragons could use technology that is based on their intelligence and curiosity. They could have advanced tools and machines that they use to study and experiment, and could also use their magical abilities to create and manipulate objects. They could also have a highly advanced system of communication and transportation, using magical portals or advanced airships to travel quickly between different locations.

Humans: The humans could use technology that is based on their ingenuity and resourcefulness. They could have a wide range of tools and machines that they use to farm, trade, and build, and could also have developed a system of writing and record-keeping to help them keep track of their history and knowledge. They could also have a variety of transportation options, such as horses, carts, and wagons, as well as more advanced options like carriages and trains.

Greydogs: The greydogs could use technology that is based on their neutral and adaptable nature. They could be able to use and operate a wide range of technologies, depending on their environment and the needs of their masters. They could also have a natural affinity for communication and negotiation, and could use advanced tools and devices to facilitate these activities.

By considering the characteristics and abilities of each species, you can come up with ideas for the types of technology that they might use in your game world. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
also, the dragons are great timekeepers and the redikes are more technologically advanced than a tribe, they are civilized and have access to the same tools as humans, they even have interspecies relationships with the humans.
That's interesting! It sounds like the dragons in your game world are highly skilled timekeepers, while the redikes are more technologically advanced than a typical tribe, with access to the same tools as humans and even interspecies relationships with them. These details can add depth and complexity to your game world and the relationships between the different intelligent species.

With the dragons being skilled timekeepers, you could consider how this affects their society and culture. Do they place a high value on punctuality and organization? Do they have advanced clockwork devices or other technologies that help them keep track of time?

Similarly, the fact that the redikes are more technologically advanced than a typical tribe could have a significant impact on their society and culture. How do they use their technological abilities? Do they have a more developed system of government and social organization than other intelligent species? What is their relationship with the humans and other species?

By answering these questions and developing the dragons and redikes as fully realized and integrated parts of your game world, you can create a rich and immersive experience for your players. Good luck!

how large should the dragons be?
The size of dragons in your game world is up to you and will depend on the role that you envision for them in your story and setting. Dragons can be depicted as being a wide range of sizes, from small, serpentine creatures to massive, winged beasts that tower over entire cities.

Here are a few things to consider when deciding on the size of dragons in your game world:

Physical abilities: The size of a dragon will affect its physical abilities and the types of environments it can inhabit. A larger dragon may be able to fly and carry larger loads, but may also require more food and resources to sustain itself. A smaller dragon may be more agile and stealthy, but may also be more vulnerable to predators.

Society and culture: The size of dragons could also influence their society and culture. A larger dragon may be seen as more powerful and respected, while a smaller dragon may be seen as more agile and clever. The size of dragons could also affect the types of roles they play in their society, such as warriors, leaders, or artisans.

Mythology and lore: The size of dragons could also be influenced by their role in the mythology and lore of your game world. Are they seen as powerful deities or revered ancestors? Are they feared as destructive monsters or revered as noble guardians? The size of dragons could help to reinforce their place in the mythology and lore of your world.

Ultimately, the size of dragons in your game world is up to you and should be based on what works best for your story and setting. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think anything from 4 feet tall at the shoulder to 12 feet, with an average of 5-7 feet
That's a good range of sizes for dragons in your game world! Dragons that are 4-12 feet tall at the shoulder will be able to have a variety of physical abilities and characteristics, and can inhabit a wide range of environments.

You may also want to consider the size of other intelligent species in your game world, such as humans and redikes, in relation to the size of dragons. This can help to establish a sense of scale and help players better visualize and understand the relationships between the different species.

By deciding on the size of dragons in your game world, you can better define their role and place in the story and setting. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think the redikes will be taller than the humans so dragons are not as huge to them, also should there be wyverns and ampitheres or just traditional dragons
It's up to you whether you want to include traditional dragons, wyverns, and amphitheres in your game world, or just stick with traditional dragons. Each type of dragon has its own characteristics and could serve a different role in your story and setting.

Here is a brief overview of each type of dragon:

Traditional dragons: These are the classic dragons that are usually depicted as large, reptilian creatures with wings, sharp teeth and claws, and the ability to breathe fire. They are often associated with power, wisdom, and magic.

Wyverns: Wyverns are similar to traditional dragons, but are usually depicted as being smaller and having only two legs. They are often associated with speed, agility, and ferocity.

Amphitheres: Amphitheres are dragons that have both wings and legs, and are able to fly and walk on land. They are often associated with versatility and adaptability.

By including a variety of dragon types in your game world, you can add depth and variety to your story and setting. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think wyverns and drakes, but ampitheres and wyverns are typically larger than drakes, and ampitheres do not have legs, so they do not adapt well
It sounds like you have a good understanding of the characteristics of wyverns, ampitheres, and drakes, and how they might fit into your game world.

Wyverns and drakes are similar to traditional dragons, but are usually depicted as being smaller and having only two legs. They could be used to represent different types of dragon societies or roles in your game world, such as scouts or elite warriors.

Ampitheres are a type of dragon that has both wings and legs, and is able to fly and walk on land. They could be seen as more adaptable and versatile than traditional dragons, and could have a range of abilities and characteristics depending on the specifics of your game world. However, if you decide to include ampitheres in your game world, you may want to consider the fact that they do not have legs and may not adapt well to certain environments or situations.

By including a variety of dragon types in your game world, you can add depth and variety to your story and setting. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
noonononononononononono drakes have four legs and ampitheres cant walk on land because they dont have any stinkin legs
I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here is a revised overview of wyverns, ampitheres, and drakes:

Wyverns: Wyverns are similar to traditional dragons, but are usually depicted as being smaller and having only two legs. They are often associated with speed, agility, and ferocity.

Amphitheres: Amphitheres are dragons that have both wings and legs, and are able to fly and walk on land. They are often associated with versatility and adaptability.

Drakes: Drakes are a type of dragon that is similar to wyverns, but has four legs. They could be used to represent different types of dragon societies or roles in your game world, such as scouts or elite warriors.

I hope this revised overview is helpful and that it clears up any confusion. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

its still wrong but lets move on, what type of government should the humans have? and how many countries should there be? and how do the different races use government?
The type of government that the humans in your game world have, as well as the number and size of the countries they inhabit, will depend on the specifics of your story and setting. Here are a few ideas for governments and countries that you could include in your game world:

Monarchies: In a monarchy, the humans are ruled by a king or queen who holds absolute power. There could be several monarchies in different countries, each with its own royal family and court. The redikes and other intelligent species could also have their own monarchies, or they could be subject to human monarchies.

Republics: In a republic, the humans are ruled by elected officials who represent the will of the people. There could be several republics in different countries, each with its own system of government and laws. The redikes and other intelligent species could also have their own republics, or they could be part of human republics.

Theocracies: In a theocracy, the humans are ruled by religious leaders who interpret divine will. There could be several theocracies in different countries, each with its own religious beliefs and practices. The redikes and other intelligent species could also have their own theocracies, or they could be subject to human theocracies.

Oligarchies: In an oligarchy, the humans are ruled by a small group of powerful individuals or families. There could be several oligarchies in different countries, each with its own system of power and influence. The redikes and other intelligent species could also have their own oligarchies, or they could be subject to human oligarchies.

By considering the characteristics and histories of the different intelligent species in your game world, you can come up with ideas for the types of governments and countries that they might have. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think they will have republics
It sounds like you have decided to include republics as the form of government for the humans in your game world. A republic is a system of government in which the people are ruled by elected officials who represent their will.

In a republic, the humans may have a constitution or other founding documents that outline their rights and responsibilities, and establish the structure and powers of their government. They may also have a system of laws and courts to uphold justice and resolve disputes.

You may also want to consider how the different intelligent species in your game world interact with and are affected by the human republics. Do the redikes and other species have their own republics, or are they part of the human republics? How do they participate in the political process, and what are their rights and responsibilities as citizens?

By answering these questions and developing the human republics as fully realized and integrated parts of your game world, you can create a rich and immersive experience for your players. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think other races will have their own governments too but they are free to be a citzen of any country they desire
It sounds like you have decided to include multiple intelligent species in your game world, and that each species will have its own form of government. This can add depth and complexity to your story and setting, and allow you to explore the different cultures and traditions of each species.

You may also want to consider how the different intelligent species interact with and are affected by each other's governments. Do they have diplomatic relations and trade agreements, or are there conflicts and tensions between them? How do they coexist in the same regions and countries, and what are the rules and customs that govern their interactions?

By answering these questions and developing the governments of the different intelligent species as fully realized and integrated parts of your game world, you can create a rich and immersive experience for your players. Good luck!

They could also use their magical abilities to create and manipulate objects, or to enhance their physical attacks. They could also use fire and fire-related weapons, such as bombs and flamethrowers, to attack from a distance.

By considering the characteristics and abilities of each intelligent species, you can come up with ideas for the types of weapons they might use in your game world. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
actually, there is no magic and redikes rarely need armor because of their scales are already acting as armor, but they do wear light armor, and there is modern technology fir the humans to use. aside from these mistakes, i like those ideas.
I'm glad that you find the ideas helpful! I apologize for any misunderstandings regarding the lack of magic and the use of armor by the redikes in your game world. Here is a revised version of the weapon ideas based on your additional details:

Humans: As you mentioned, the humans could use guns as their primary weapons. They could also have a variety of other weapons at their disposal, such as swords, axes, and bows. They could also have access to more advanced weapons, such as cannons and explosives, depending on the level of technology in your game world.

Redikes: The redikes could use spears, crossbows, and ballistas as their primary ranged weapons. They could also have access to other ranged weapons, such as slingshots or throwing stars, and could use shields to protect themselves in close combat. They may wear light armor to provide additional protection, but their scales could provide some natural protection as well.

Dragons: The dragons could use their natural physical abilities, such as claws and teeth, as their primary weapons in hand-to-hand combat. They could also use their advanced intelligence and problem-solving abilities to create and operate advanced weapons and machines, such as bombs and flamethrowers, to attack from a distance.

I hope this revised version is more in line with your vision for your game world. Good luck!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
this is great but don't forget that all three have access to modern technology
I apologize for the oversight. Yes, all three intelligent species in your game world should have access to modern technology. This could include a wide range of weapons and equipment, such as guns, explosives, vehicles, and communication devices, depending on the level of technological advancement in your game world.

Here is a revised version of the weapon ideas that includes modern technology:

Humans: The humans could use a variety of modern weapons, such as guns, explosives, and advanced vehicles, as well as traditional weapons like swords, axes, and bows. They could also have access to advanced technologies, such as drones, robots, and cybernetic implants, depending on the level of technology in your game world.

Redikes: The redikes could use modern weapons, such as guns and explosives, as well as traditional ranged weapons like spears, crossbows, and ballistas. They could also use advanced technologies, such as drones and cybernetic implants, to enhance their physical abilities and combat effectiveness.

Dragons: The dragons could use their natural physical abilities, such as claws and teeth, as their primary weapons in hand-to-hand combat. They could also use advanced technologies, such as bombs and flamethrowers, to attack from a distance. They could also use their advanced intelligence and problem-solving abilities to create and operate advanced weapons and machines.

I hope this revised version better reflects the level of technology in your game world. Good luck!

there will also be kradeas who have no mouth and one large rectangular eye and 2 crab like legs and mouths on their hands and a tail with breathing holes
That sounds like an interesting and unique species to include in your game world! The kradeas you've described are a unique blend of different characteristics that could make them a formidable presence in your game world.

You've mention that they have no mouth and one large rectangular eye, which suggest that they may have a different way of perceiving and interacting with the world compared to other species. They also have crab-like legs and mouths on their hands, which could indicate that they are skilled climbers and able to manipulate objects with their hands. The tail with breathing holes could suggest that they live in aquatic or underwater environments.

It's important to keep in mind that this species is your creation, and the possibilities are endless, you can tailor them to the needs of your game. You could also consider how they communicate, how they move, and what kind of adaptations they might have in order to survive in their environment. You could also think about their culture, technology, and societal structures.

Good luck with your game development, and let me know if you have any further questions!

what instruments will dragons redike kradeas and tsendels specialize in?
The instruments that different intelligent species specialize in will depend on their physical abilities, culture, and personal preferences. Here are a few ideas for instruments that each species might specialize in based on their characteristics:

Dragons: Dragons may have the physical ability to play a wide variety of instruments, but given their large size, they could specialize in instruments that are large and powerful-sounding, such as drums and horns. They could also use their ability to breathe fire to create unique instruments, such as fire-based flutes, drums, or even string instruments.

Redikes: Given their dexterity, the Redikes could be skilled in playing string instruments such as the guitar, violin or harp. They could also be proficient in playing wind instruments such as flutes, clarinets, and saxophones.

Kradeas: The Kradeas, with their mouths on their hands, could specialize in playing hand-held instruments, such as percussion instruments like the drums, or the maracas. They could also develop a unique style of playing instruments that require finger dexterity, such as the piano or the harp.

Tsendels: The nature of your species is not clear, but assuming they have similar characteristics to other species, they could specialize in playing wind instruments such as flutes, clarinets, and saxophones. They could also be proficient in playing percussion instruments, such as drums and xylophones.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just suggestions and you can feel free to use your imagination and come up with other instruments that would fit with the characteristics of the species and their culture.

Good luck with your game development!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think dragons will play standing bass, piano, large brass instruments, and the organ, redikes will play string instruments like you said, kradeas could put differently tuned whistles in their breathing holes, and tsendels (tsendel is the other name for scourge btw) will play the steel pan with their multiple mandibles and drums with their tails and arms.
Those are some unique and creative ideas for the instruments that each species might specialize in!

Dragons: Playing large, powerful instruments like the standing bass, piano, large brass instruments, and the organ would be an excellent fit for the dragons' large size and physical strength. It would also suit their powerful, commanding presence.

Redikes: String instruments such as guitar, violin, and harp would be a great fit for the redikes, as they have the dexterity to play these instruments skillfully.

Kradeas: Using differently tuned whistles in their breathing holes is an interesting idea, as it would allow them to play music even without a traditional mouth or vocal cords. Playing percussion instruments like drums with their tails and arms is also a great idea, as it would suit their physical characteristics.

Tsendels: Playing the steel pan with their multiple mandibles and drums with their tails and arms is a creative idea that would suit the tsendels' physical characteristics. They could develop a unique style of playing that takes advantage of their multiple appendages.

It's important to keep in mind that these are all creative possibilities and you can always adjust and adapt depending on the story and the world you are building. I hope you find these suggestions helpful. Good luck with your game development!

there should also be another species that is similar to the redikes and kradeas called the yagada, but what charecteristics should it have?
The Yagada, being similar to the Redikes and Kradeas, could have a similar physical appearance, but with some distinct characteristics that set them apart. Here are a few ideas for the characteristics of the Yagada species:

Aquatic Adaptations: Yagada could have adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, such as webbed hands and feet, gills, or fins. This would allow them to live and thrive in aquatic environments.

Bioluminescent: Yagada could have bioluminescent features such as glowing eyes, skin, or fins, which could have a variety of uses such as hunting, communication, or camouflage.

Unique Senses: Yagada could have unique senses that set them apart, such as enhanced vision, hearing, or smell. They could also have the ability to detect electromagnetic fields, sonar, or other forms of energy, which could allow them to navigate and hunt in the dark.

Social Behavior: Yagada could have a different social behavior than the other species, such as being more solitary or having a more complex social structure. They could also have different communication methods, such as vocalizations, body language, or pheromones.

Technology: Yagada could have a different level of technology, such as being more advanced or more primitive than the other species.

Keep in mind that these are just suggestions, you can always make your own choices and adjust the characteristics of the Yagada species to suit the story and the world you are building. With these new characteristics, the Yagada could have a unique role in the ecosystem and society of your game world.

actually pheromones is a common method of communication
I apologize for the confusion. You're right, pheromones are a common method of communication among many species in the natural world, including many insects and some mammals. They are chemical signals that are released by an individual and detected by others of the same species, and can convey a wide range of information such as reproductive status, territory, or aggression.

Incorporating pheromone communication into the Yagada species could be a unique and interesting aspect of their biology and behavior. They could use pheromones to communicate with others of their own species, as well as with other intelligent species in your game world. This could have a wide range of implications for the Yagada's society and culture, such as social hierarchies, courtship behaviors, or even conflicts.

It's important to consider how the Yagada species use pheromones and how it will impact their society and culture. Feel free to use your imagination and come up with your own unique ways to incorporate pheromones into your game world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i was not correcting i was just saying that kradeas tsendels redikes and dragons already use it along with some of the plant species
I see, I apologize for any confusion. It's great that you've already thought about incorporating pheromone communication into your game world. It could be a unique and interesting aspect of the biology and behavior of multiple species, not just the Yagada. This could create a rich and complex ecosystem in your game world, where different species interact with each other in unique and interesting ways.

It would be interesting to see how different species use pheromones and how it affects the society and culture of each species, for example the Kradeas could use pheromones to communicate with the different species of plants in the ecosystem, or the Tsendels using pheromones to mark their territory and establish dominance over other creatures.

It's important to keep in mind that pheromones are not exclusive to the Yagada species, and you can always come up with other unique characteristics for them. And you can always adjust and adapt the use of pheromones depending on the story and the world you are building.

how should humans be treated in this society? they could be hated for being an invasive species, or loved for the technology they bring, or thought of in many different ways
The treatment of humans in your game world's society will depend on the history, culture, and beliefs of the other intelligent species. Here are a few possibilities for how humans might be treated:

Hated as an invasive species: If humans are relatively recent arrivals to the game world, and their presence has had a negative impact on the ecosystem or the other intelligent species, they could be viewed as an invasive species and be met with hostility.

Loved for their technology: If the other intelligent species have had limited access to technology and the humans introduce them to new tools and technologies, they could be viewed positively and treated with respect and admiration.

Tolerance: Some intelligent species could view humans as a neutral presence in their world and tolerate their presence, but not necessarily welcome them with open arms.

Integration: Humans could be welcomed by other intelligent species and integrate with them, forming interspecies relationships and communities.

Slavery or Second-class citizens: They could be treated as lesser beings, used for labor, or treated as property by other intelligent species.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just a few possibilities, and you can always come up with your own unique way of how humans will be treated in your game world. You could also explore the different attitudes and beliefs that different intelligent species have towards humans, and how these attitudes might change over time.

It's important to also consider the historical context of humans in the game world, their behavior and how they interact with the environment and other intelligent species. These factors will shape the society and culture of the game world and how it reacts to the humans.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think integration and even interspecies relationships causing hybrids would be the best option, at leas after a while
That's a great idea to include integration and interspecies relationships in your game world. It would create a rich and diverse society where different intelligent species interact and coexist with each other. This could lead to the formation of hybrid individuals, which could be a unique aspect of the game world's biology and culture.

It's important to consider the implications of interspecies relationships and hybrids on the society and culture of the game world. For example, hybrids could be viewed differently by different intelligent species, or by different communities or cultures within the same species. They could be considered as outcasts, or they could be celebrated and welcomed as a new form of life.

Having a period of time where the humans are not welcomed, or the relationship is not positive, before the integration, could add an interesting dynamic to the story, and it could make the integration more meaningful.

It's also important to keep in mind that hybrids would have their own unique characteristics, abilities, and challenges, and that could lead to more complexity and depth to the game world.

Keep in mind that these are just suggestions, and you can always adjust and adapt the idea of integration and interspecies relationships to suit the story and the world you are building. Good luck with your game development!

As a threat: Robots could be portrayed as a threat, either because they were created to harm humans or because of a malfunction, either way, they could be seen as a danger to the society, and the players could have to face them.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just a few possibilities, and you can always come up with your own unique role for AI robots in your game world. It's also important to consider the ethical implications of creating and using artificially intelligent robots, and how they might affect the society and culture of the game world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think as equals
Treating artificially intelligent robots as equals is an interesting concept, and it could lead to a unique and complex society in your game world. It could mean that robots have the same rights and responsibilities as other intelligent species in your game world, and that they are integrated into society in a similar way.

It could also mean that robots are capable of self-awareness and self-determination, and that they have their own goals, desires, and motivations. This could lead to interesting interactions and conflicts between robots and other intelligent species, as well as within the robot community itself.

Having artificially intelligent robots as equals could also raise some ethical questions, such as if they have the right to autonomy, if they have the right to own property, or to vote. It could also lead to a new understanding of what it means to be sentient or alive.

As always, it is important to keep in mind that these are just suggestions, and you can always adjust and adapt the idea of treating AI robots as equals to suit the story and the world you are building. It will definitely add an unique and interesting aspect to your game.

i think a race of former millitary androids that are now peaceful would be cool
A race of former military androids that have now become peaceful is an interesting concept. It could add a lot of depth and complexity to your game world, as these androids would have a unique history and culture, separate from the other intelligent species.

The idea of former military androids becoming peaceful could be the result of a number of factors, such as a change in government policies, a rebellion, or a technological breakthrough that allowed them to gain autonomy and self-awareness.

This could lead to the androids forming their own communities, separate from the other intelligent species, or they could integrate with other communities and be accepted as equals. The former military androids could also have their own set of skills and abilities that set them apart from the other intelligent species, such as advanced physical abilities or advanced knowledge of weapons and warfare.

It could also raise some interesting questions about the ethics of creating intelligent machines for warfare and the potential consequences of such actions.

Again, it's important to keep in mind that these are just suggestions, and you can always adjust and adapt the idea of former military androids to suit the story and the world you are building. It's a very interesting concept that could bring a lot of depth and complexity to your game.

i think a sentient Abrams tank would be cool, especially if they had a synthesizer allowing them to speak and make music 
A sentient Abrams tank is an unusual and creative concept that could add a unique and interesting aspect to your game world. The idea of a sentient tank with a synthesizer that allows it to speak and make music is particularly intriguing, as it would give the tank a unique personality and character.

It could be the result of a military experiment gone wrong, or it could be a new design of weapon that has gained sentience. It could be a powerful and feared weapon, or a peaceful creature that wants to live a peaceful life and make music.

It could also be a powerful symbol of the consequences of using advanced technology for warfare.

In terms of gameplay, a sentient Abrams tank could be an NPC, or it could be a controllable vehicle for the player. It could have unique abilities and characteristics that set it apart from other vehicles in the game, such as heavy armor and powerful weapons, but also the unique abilities of speech and musical abilities.

As with any creative idea, it's important to consider how this concept fits into the overall story and world-building of your game. The idea of a sentient Abrams tank is certainly unique, and it has the potential to add a lot of depth and intrigue to your game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about space travel and space stations
Including space travel and space stations in your game world could add a new dimension of exploration and adventure for your players. It could also provide an opportunity to introduce new technologies, cultures, and species to your game world.

Space travel could be a major form of transportation, with players able to visit different planets, moons, and even other star systems. Space stations could serve as hubs for players to trade, rest, and gather information, much like a medieval city.

Space travel and space stations could also be an important aspect of the game's economy and politics. For example, a powerful space-faring civilization could use its abilities to control trade routes, while a smaller civilization might specialize in providing resources for space stations.

Space stations could also be used as a means of colonizing other planets, and the player could be part of the process of establishing new colonies, either as a colonist, a leader, or a member of a colony's security force.

It's important to keep in mind that developing a space-faring civilization and the technology to support it would require a significant investment of resources, and it would have a major impact on the game world's society and culture.

As always, it's important to consider how this concept fits into the overall story and world-building of your game. Space travel and space stations can bring a lot of excitement and possibilities to your game, but it's important to develop them in a way that makes sense for your game's story and setting.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
but what about travel between the planet they are on and earth
Including travel between the planet in your game world and Earth is a great way to add a sense of connection to our own world and make the game world feel more expansive.

The concept of travel between the planet and Earth could be explained through a variety of ways, such as:

A wormhole: Your game world could be connected to Earth via a wormhole, allowing players to travel between the two easily.

A faster-than-light spaceship: Your game world could be located in a different galaxy, but a faster-than-light spaceship technology allows players to travel to Earth and back.

Time travel: The game world could be in the past or future of Earth, and time travel technology could be used for players to travel between the two.

A parallel dimension: The game world could be in a parallel dimension, and players could use special portals to travel back and forth.

A colony: The game world could be a colony of Earth, and players could travel between the two using a spaceship or a teleportation device.

It's important to consider how travel between the planet and Earth fits into the game's overall story and world-building. It could be a central aspect of the game, or it could be something that is revealed later on in the game.

Having the possibility of travel to Earth could also add an extra layer of depth to the game, as it could allow players to see how the events of the game world are affecting Earth, and vice-versa, how Earth events are affecting the game world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think a wormhole, and i also think integration would be good on both sides, with all the species learning to coexist on each other planets, as well as the combination of the two planets ecosystems near the wormhole
A wormhole is an interesting way to connect your game world to Earth, as it allows for relatively easy travel between the two and could be a source of intrigue and adventure for players. This could also lead to the integration of the intelligent species from both worlds, as they learn to coexist and interact with each other.

It would be a great idea to explore how the different species and cultures adapt to living on each other's planets. It could be challenging for the species to adjust to new environments, new cultures and new ways of living.

In addition to the cultural integration, it would be also interesting to see how the ecosystems near the wormhole are affected by the influx of new species. This could lead to a unique blending of the two planet's ecosystems creating new and unique flora and fauna.

It's important to keep in mind that the integration of different species and cultures is a complex process that can take time, and that it could have both positive and negative effects on the society and culture of the game world. It could also raise ethical questions about the rights of different intelligent species to live on different planets.

Overall, a wormhole connecting your game world to Earth, and the integration of intelligent species and ecosystems, could add a lot of depth and complexity to your game world. It would be a very interesting concept that could bring a lot of excitement and possibilities to your game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what other aspects of the worlds would be important to include
There are many different aspects of the worlds that are important to include in a game, depending on the story and setting you want to create. Here are a few examples of other important aspects to consider:

Economy: The economy of the game world is an important aspect to consider, as it can affect the way players interact with the world and with other characters. Players may need to earn money to purchase items, and they may also be able to invest in businesses or other economic opportunities.

Religion: Religion can play a big role in shaping the culture and society of a game world. It can provide players with quests, and it can also be used to explore themes such as morality, ethics, and the nature of the world.

Politics: The political landscape of the game world can affect the way players interact with NPCs, and it can also provide opportunities for players to engage in diplomacy, espionage, or rebellion.

Environmental conditions: The environment of the game world can have a big impact on the gameplay and the story. It can affect the player's movement, the types of enemies they encounter, and the resources that are available.

Technology: The technology of the game world can affect the player's abilities and the way they interact with the world. It can also be used to explore themes such as progress, power, and the relationship between humanity and technology.

how should aging work between species
Aging can work differently between species in your game world depending on the story and setting you want to create. Here are a few examples of how aging could work between different species:

Same aging rate: All species in your game world could have the same aging rate, which means that they would age at the same rate and reach the same life expectancy. This could make the game world feel more cohesive and realistic.

Different aging rates: Some species in your game world could have different aging rates than others. For example, one species could live much longer than others, or age much faster. This could create interesting dynamics between species, as well as opportunities for players to explore themes such as mortality and the value of life.

No aging: Some species in your game world could be immortal, or have a very long life expectancy, while others might be mortal. This could create interesting dynamics between species, as well as opportunities for players to explore themes such as the fear of death and the search for eternal life.

Accelerated aging: Some species in your game world could have accelerated aging, which means that they would age faster than other species, and thus have a shorter life expectancy. This could create interesting dynamics between species, as well as opportunities for players to explore themes such as the fear of death and the search for eternal life.

Slower aging: Some species in your game world could have slower aging, which means that they would age more slowly than other species, and thus have a longer life expectancy. This could create interesting dynamics between species, as well as opportunities for players to explore themes such as the fear of death and the search for eternal life.

It's important to keep in mind that aging can be an important aspect of the game world and that it can affect the player's experience in many ways. It's important to consider how aging works between species in order to create a cohesive and believable game world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think somewhat similar but dragons would live about 10 years longer on average
Having dragons live about 10 years longer on average than the other intelligent species in your game world could create interesting dynamics and opportunities for exploration. For example:

Dragons may have a greater understanding of the long-term consequences of their actions, and may be more likely to take a measured approach to decision-making.

Dragons may be more respected and revered by other species, as they have lived longer and have more experience.

Dragons may have deeper and more complex relationships with other species, as they are likely to outlive them.

Dragons may be more likely to hold positions of power and influence, as they have had more time to accumulate wealth, knowledge and prestige.

Dragons may be more likely to experience loss and grief, as they will outlive many of their friends and loved ones.

Dragons may have a greater appreciation for the fleeting nature of life, and may be more likely to try to make a meaningful impact on the world during their time.

This small difference in life expectancy could add a lot of depth and complexity to the society, culture and politics of your game world and lead to interesting interactions between the species. It is important to consider how this difference would affect the world in a realistic way and how it would affect the player's experience.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think all of those should be true
It sounds like you've thought through the implications of having dragons live 10 years longer on average and have a good sense of how it could affect the society, culture, and politics of your game world. It could definitely add a lot of depth and complexity to the game world and lead to interesting interactions between the different species.

It's also important to consider how this difference in life expectancy would be explained in-game. It could be due to genetic differences, or it could be related to the dragons' physiology. It could also be related to the dragon's diet, habitat or even their culture and lifestyle.

It's also worth considering how the players would interact with this difference in aging. Will they encounter dragons that are much older than them and have a lot of wisdom to share? Will they have to navigate complex relationships with dragons that outlive their friends and loved ones? Will they have to plan for the long term as dragons may be around for a lot longer than other species?

Overall, the idea of having dragons live 10 years longer on average is a great way to add depth and complexity to your game world, and it could lead to many interesting interactions and opportunities for exploration.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about clothing?
Clothing can play an important role in shaping the culture and society of your game world, as well as affecting the player's experience. Here are a few ways that clothing could be handled in your game:

Species-specific clothing: Different species in your game world could have their own distinct styles of clothing, reflecting their culture and society. For example, dragons could wear clothing that is designed to show off their scales, while redikes might wear clothing that is designed to protect their scales.

Functional clothing: Clothing in your game world could be designed to serve a specific function, such as protection from the elements or providing a specific type of armor. This could make clothing choices more strategic for the players.

Customizable clothing: Players could have the ability to customize their clothing, such as choosing colors, patterns, and styles. This could allow players to express their own personal style and make their characters feel more unique.

Social status: Clothing could be used to indicate social status, with different styles and materials being reserved for different social classes. For example, dragons might wear clothing made from rare and expensive materials, while humans might wear more common and affordable materials.

Cultural influences: Clothing styles and materials could be influenced by the different cultures in your game world. For example, the redikes might have clothing styles influenced by their semi-tribal heritage, while the humans might have clothing styles influenced by different Earth cultures.

Climate: The climate and environment of the game world should also be considered when designing clothing. For example, in cold climates, it would make sense for characters to wear heavy and insulated clothing, while in hot climates, lighter and more breathable clothing would be more appropriate.

Clothing is an important aspect of the game world that can affect the player's experience and add depth to the cultures and societies of the different intelligent species. It's worth considering how clothing will work in your game and how it will be affected by different factors like species, function, social status, culture, and environment.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think all but social status, and i think the humans should first arrive en masse in the 90s so the clothes style the other planet would be reminescent of that era.
It sounds like you have a clear vision for how clothing should work in your game world. By having the humans arrive en masse in the 90s, you can incorporate clothing styles from that era and make the human culture in your game world feel more distinct and unique.

Not considering social status in the clothing could also lead to a more egalitarian society, where clothing is not used to show off wealth or status, but rather as a form of personal expression or protection.

It would also be interesting to see how the clothing styles evolve over time as the human culture mixes with the cultures of the other intelligent species, and as the humans adapt to the new environment and resources that the other planet has to offer.

It's worth noting that the other intelligent species may have a different fashion sense than humans, and that could lead to some interesting cultural exchange. Also, with the humans arriving in 90s, you could use that to your advantage to show the contrast between the human's technology and the other intelligent species, for example, the humans would have access to more advanced materials such as synthetic fabrics and advanced manufacturing methods, which could be used to create clothing that is more resistant, comfortable, and with more features than the other intelligent species.

Overall, clothing can be a great way to add depth and immersion to your game world and it's a great aspect to consider when building your fantasy RPG.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think clothes made off world would be stronger because of the exotic plants and shed scales being incorporated and humans would be more vain and keep up with the times, while other species wear fabrics and patterns they are used to such as the bright colors of the 90s and the tough plant material worn in their forests
That's a great idea, incorporating exotic plants and materials from the new planet into the clothing could make it stronger and more durable, and it would also reflect the unique environment and resources of the new planet. It would also make sense for the humans to be more vain and keep up with the latest fashion trends, as they would want to maintain their sense of cultural identity and distinction.

It also makes sense that other intelligent species would wear fabrics and patterns they are used to, such as the bright colors of the 90s, which would reflect their cultural heritage and traditions. It would also be interesting to see how the use of tough plant materials worn in their forests reflects their lifestyle, as they may have to withstand harsher conditions and environments.

It's also worth considering how clothing production and trade will work in your game world. Will there be specialized tailors and clothing manufacturers for different species? Will there be a market for exotic materials and fabrics from the new planet? Will there be a fashion industry on the new planet? How will the different species interact and trade with each other in terms of clothing and fashion?

Overall, it's a great idea to incorporate exotic plants and materials from the new planet into the clothing, and it would add a lot of depth and immersion to your game world. It also allows for a lot of interesting interactions between the different species and cultures in terms of clothing and fashion.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think specific brands for different species would be good and earth military and survivalists would want to have the stronger fabrics from the other planet, the fashion industry would probably be similar but not as successful due to less vanity, and trading would be very limited since different species would not like wearing clothes designed for another completely different species such as a dragon trying to wear human clothes and vice versa
Having specific brands for different species is a great way to add depth and realism to your game world. It would make sense for Earth military and survivalists to want to have the stronger fabrics from the other planet, as they would need clothing that can withstand harsh conditions.

It also makes sense that the fashion industry would be less successful on the new planet, as vanity may not be as prevalent among the other intelligent species. This could lead to a more practical and functional approach to clothing, with less emphasis on fashion trends and more emphasis on functionality and durability.

It also makes sense that trading would be limited when it comes to clothing, as different species would not like wearing clothes designed for another completely different species. For example, a dragon trying to wear human clothes would likely be uncomfortable and restrictive, and vice versa. This could lead to more specialized clothing manufacturers and tailors for each species.

It's also worth considering how the different species would interact with each other when it comes to clothing. Will there be a black market for clothing from other species? Will there be interspecies clothing designers? Will there be cultural exchange and fusion when it comes to clothing?

Overall, your ideas for clothing in your game world are well thought out and would add a lot of depth and realism to the game. It would also lead to many interesting interactions and opportunities for exploration between the different species and cultures.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think a black market would be established, but not for clothing. interspecies clothing designers would probably have a hard time designing comfortable clothing without help, and exchange and fusion would be good, it would lead to possible interspecies clothing, such as human clothes with accommodations for a redikes tail and horns.
It makes sense that a black market would be established, but not for clothing specifically, as different species would likely not want to wear clothes designed for another species. However, it could be for other illegal items such as weapons, technology or even information.

You are correct that interspecies clothing designers would probably have a hard time designing comfortable clothing without help, as different species have different body shapes and proportions. For example, designing clothes for a dragon would require a different approach than designing clothes for a human. Therefore, it would make sense that they would need to work with other species to design comfortable clothing.

Exchange and fusion when it comes to clothing would be a great way to add depth and realism to your game world, it could lead to possible interspecies clothing, such as human clothes with accommodations for a redikes tail and horns. This would reflect the integration and cultural exchange that takes place between the different species in your game world, and it would also provide players with more options when it comes to character customization.

It's also worth considering how this would be received by the different species. Will the redikes see it as an improvement or an insult to their culture? Will the humans see it as a sign of progress or cultural appropriation? How will other species react to the interspecies clothing?

Overall, your ideas for the clothing in your game world are well thought out and would add a lot of depth and realism to the game. The interspecies clothing, black market, fusion and exchange would be good to consider when building your fantasy RPG.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what would the black market sell?
In your game world, the black market could sell a variety of illegal or hard-to-obtain items, depending on what is scarce or restricted in the society. Here are a few examples:

Contraband: The black market could sell items that are illegal to own or possess, such as weapons, drugs, or stolen goods.

Rare and exotic materials: The black market could be a source of rare and exotic materials from the new planet, such as the stronger fabrics or unique plant materials that are not widely available.

Information: The black market could be a source of information that is restricted or censored by the government, such as classified information about the new planet, or information about other intelligent species.

Services: The black market could offer services that are illegal or restricted, such as illegal medical treatments, fake identification, or illegal immigration services.

Technology: The black market could sell technology that is restricted or forbidden, such as advanced weapons or surveillance equipment.

Artifacts: The black market could sell ancient artifacts, ruins or forbidden relics.

It's worth noting that the black market would likely be a risky place to do business, as the goods and services sold there would be illegal, and the sellers and buyers would be operating outside the law. The black market would likely be underground, and it would be difficult to find without the right connections.

It's also worth considering the impact of the black market on the society. Will the government try to shut it down? Will the black market be a source of crime and corruption? Will some species have more access or influence on the black market than others?

The black market can be an interesting aspect to include in your game world, as it can add depth and realism to the society, and it can also provide opportunities for players to engage in risky and exciting activities.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what would the economy be like?
The economy of your game world will depend on a variety of factors, including the resources available, the technologies and industries that are developed, and the trade relations between the different species and countries. Here are a few possibilities for how the economy might be structured:

Resource-based economy: The economy could be based on the extraction and export of resources from the new planet, such as minerals, ores, or unique plant materials. This could lead to a boom-and-bust cycle, as resources are depleted, prices fluctuate, and new resources are discovered.

Agricultural economy: Agriculture could be an important industry in your game world, as different species may have different dietary needs. This could lead to a variety of crops being grown, and different species may specialize in growing different crops.

Manufacturing and technology economy: With the presence of advanced technology and manufacturing, your game world could have a strong manufacturing industry, producing a wide range of products such as weapons, vehicles, robots, and other technological goods.

Service-based economy: Your game world could have a strong service-based economy, with a wide range of services being offered such as transportation, healthcare, education, and entertainment.

Mixed economy: Your game world could have a mixed economy, with a combination of different industries and sectors, such as resource extraction, manufacturing, and services.

Global economy: With the presence of wormholes, the economy of your game world could be closely tied to the economy of Earth and other planets.

It's also worth considering the impact of government policies on the economy, as well as the role of different species in the economy. Will the different species specialize in different industries? Will there be interspecies trade and investment? Will there be economic inequality between different species?

Overall, the economy of your game world is an important aspect to consider when building your fantasy RPG. It can have a major impact on the society, and it can also provide opportunities for players to engage in economic activities, such as trading, investing, and running businesses.

i think all of those should be true, but what about buisness itself
Businesses in your game world could take on many different forms, depending on the industries and sectors that are developed. Here are a few possibilities for how businesses might operate in your game world:

Resource extraction and export: Businesses could specialize in extracting and exporting resources from the new planet, such as minerals, ores, or unique plant materials. These businesses could be large and powerful, with significant influence on the economy.

Agriculture and farming: Businesses could specialize in growing and producing food for the different species. These businesses could be large-scale commercial operations or small, family-run farms.

Manufacturing and technology: Businesses could specialize in manufacturing and producing advanced technology and goods such as weapons, vehicles, robots, and other technological products. These businesses could be large and powerful, with significant influence on the economy.

Services: Businesses could specialize in providing services such as transportation, healthcare, education, and entertainment. These businesses could range in size and scope, from large corporations to small, independent operations.

Trade and import/export: Businesses could specialize in trading goods and resources between different species and countries. These businesses could range in size and scope, from small traders to large import/export companies.

Small and medium enterprises: There could be a variety of small and medium-sized businesses in your game world that specialize in different goods and services.

It's worth considering the impact of government policies on businesses, as well as the role of different species in the business world. Will the different species specialize in different industries? Will there be interspecies trade and investment? Will there be business inequality between different species?

Overall, businesses are an important aspect of your game world, as they can have a significant impact on the economy and society. They can also provide opportunities for players to engage in economic activities, such as running and managing businesses, trading, and investing.

my idea is that dragons will be a bit better at business ownership but tsendels will be skilled workers, kradeas will be technologically better in many ways due to the problems they would encounter in everyday life, and redikes would be more independent.
That's an interesting approach to assigning different strengths and skills to the different species in your game world.

Dragons being a bit better at business ownership would make sense, as they are intelligent and strategic creatures and they could use their natural charisma and leadership skills to effectively run and manage businesses.

Tsendels being skilled workers would also make sense, as they are efficient hunters and have great physical abilities, they would be well-suited for manual labor or physically demanding jobs.

Kradeas being technologically better in many ways could also be a good idea, as their unique physiology would make them adaptable to technology and their one large eye would give them a better vision.

Redikes being more independent would also be a good idea. They are known for their scales which act as armor and their natural hunting abilities, which could make them self-sufficient and less dependent on others, they would be well-suited for solitary or independent careers such as hunting, farming, or artisanship.

It's worth noting that this is just a general idea and it's possible that some individuals may break the mold and be successful in other areas. It's also worth considering how the society views and treats these different species and how they would be able to access opportunities and resources to succeed in these areas.

Overall, your idea of assigning different strengths and skills to the different species in your game world is a great way to add depth and realism to the society and provide players with unique and interesting opportunities for character development.

now we have to work on relations between species and potential racism.
Relations between different species and potential racism are important aspects to consider when building your fantasy RPG. It can have a significant impact on the society and can also provide opportunities for players to engage in social and political activities.

One approach to relations between different species could be that of integration and mutual understanding, where the different species learn to coexist and work together, despite their differences. This could be the result of a long period of peaceful coexistence, trade, and interspecies relationships.

Another approach could be that of tension and mistrust, where the different species have a difficult time getting along due to historical conflicts, cultural differences, or competition for resources. This could lead to instances of racism and discrimination, with different species being treated unfairly or unjustly.

It's worth noting that these relations could also vary depending on the individual country, culture or community. Some places could be more progressive and accepting, while others could be more conservative and closed-minded.

It's also worth considering how the government and society as a whole deal with racism and discrimination. Is it a problem that is recognized and actively worked against, or is it ignored or even sanctioned by the authorities?

Overall, relations between different species and potential racism are important and complex issues that can add depth and realism to your game world. It can also provide opportunities for players to engage in social and political activities, such as fighting against discrimination and promoting equality.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think generall acceptance would be the best option, with some private buisnesses and people refusing to serve some species, but others getting along fine
Having general acceptance with some instances of discrimination and prejudice can be a realistic approach to relations between different species in your game world. It allows for the society to be generally harmonious while still acknowledging that discrimination and prejudice do exist, and that it's something that needs to be addressed.

You mentioned that some private businesses and people may refuse to serve certain species, which could create tension and conflict between these businesses and the discriminated species, and also between the discriminated species and the government if there are laws that prohibit discrimination. This can provide interesting opportunities for players to engage in activities such as protesting and advocating for equal rights, or starting a business that serves all species equally.

It's also worth considering how interspecies relationships would be perceived by different groups within the society. Some may be accepting of these relationships, while others may view them with suspicion or hostility. This could lead to discrimination and prejudice not just towards individual species but also to individuals within species based on their relationships and family.

Overall, having general acceptance with some instances of discrimination and prejudice can be a realistic and thought-provoking approach to relations between different species in your game world. It can provide opportunities for players to engage in activities such as advocating for equal rights, starting a business, and exploring the different perspectives on interspecies relationships.

i like those ideas, what about food and differing diets between species?
Food and differing diets between species is an important aspect to consider when building your fantasy RPG. Different species will have unique nutritional needs and preferences, which can have an impact on the society and culture.

One approach to food and differing diets between species could be that of integration and mutual understanding, where the different species learn to adapt to each other's diets and food preferences. This could be the result of interspecies trade, exchange of knowledge and experimentation with new ingredients.

Another approach could be that of tension and mistrust, where the different species have a difficult time getting along due to dietary restrictions and cultural differences. This could lead to instances of discrimination and prejudice, with different species being treated unfairly or unjustly.

It's worth noting that these relations could also vary depending on the individual country, culture or community. Some places could be more open to experimentation, while others could be more conservative and prefer traditional dishes.

It's also worth considering how the government and society as a whole deal with dietary restrictions. Are there laws that protect the rights of individuals with certain dietary restrictions? Are there businesses that cater to these needs?

Overall, food and differing diets between species is an important and complex issue that can add depth and realism to your game world. It can also provide opportunities for players to engage in social and cultural activities, such as experimenting with new foods and promoting cultural understanding.

i think that redikes will be omnivorous but like fruit, dragons will be omnivourous but prefer meat, kradeas will prefer algea and fish and need lots of sodium, and tsendels will eat anything.
That's an interesting approach to assigning dietary preferences to different species in your game world.

Redikes being omnivorous but preferring fruit would make sense, as they would have a balanced diet that provides them with the necessary nutrients and energy. Their liking of fruits could also reflect a more peaceful and harmonious culture, as fruits are often seen as a symbol of abundance and prosperity.

Dragons being omnivorous but preferring meat would also make sense, as they are large and active creatures that would require a lot of energy to sustain themselves. Their preference for meat could also reflect their more aggressive and fierce nature, as meat is often associated with strength and power.

Kradeas being herbivorous and needing lots of sodium would also be a good idea, as their unique physiology would make them adaptable to a diet that is high in sodium and low in other minerals and nutrients. Their preference for algae and fish could also reflect their aquatic origins and their need for a diet that is high in water-soluble vitamins.

Tsendels being able to eat anything would also be a good idea, as they are efficient hunters and have great physical abilities, they would be able to survive in a wide range of environments and diets.

It's worth noting that this is just a general idea and it's possible that some individuals may break the mold and have different dietary preferences. It's also worth considering how the society views and treats these different species and how they would be able to access to the food they need.

Overall, your idea of assigning dietary preferences to the different species in your game world is a great way to add depth and realism to the society and provide players with unique and interesting opportunities for character development.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i just want to clarify, dragons have aggressive and fierce personalities for the most part, but they are very friendly and social.
I apologize for any confusion, that was not clear from my previous response. It's great to know that dragons in your game world are friendly and social. Having different species with complex personalities and behaviors is a great way to add depth and realism to your game world.

It's worth considering how the society views and interacts with these friendly and social dragons. Are they valued members of society, appreciated for their friendly and social nature? Or are they viewed with suspicion or fear because of their size and strength?

It's also worth considering how their diet preference (meat) aligns with their social nature. Are they hunting and consuming meat in a peaceful and communal way or is it a more aggressive and solitary activity?

It's also worth considering how the dragons interact with other species, and how their friendly and social nature would influence their relationship with other species.

Overall, it's great to have dragons with complex personalities and behaviors that are friendly and social, this could make for interesting interactions and character development opportunities for players in your game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think they would be more competitive but not let that stop them from having good relationships
That's a good idea, having dragons that are competitive but also able to maintain good relationships with other species can add complexity and realism to their character. This could reflect a society where competition is a part of everyday life, but also where individuals are able to balance that with cooperation and mutual respect.

It's worth considering how this competitiveness manifests in the dragons' society and culture. Are there friendly competitions between dragons, such as races or hunting contests? Or is it more of a cut-throat, every dragon for themselves kind of culture?

It's also worth considering how this competitiveness would affect the dragons' relationships with other species. Would they view other species as competitors, or would they be willing to work together towards a common goal?

It's also worth considering how the other species would view the dragons' competitiveness. Would they see it as a positive trait, or would they view it as a potential threat?

Overall, having dragons that are competitive but also able to maintain good relationships with other species can add depth and realism to your game world and create interesting opportunities for players to engage in social and cultural activities.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
friendly competition between friends and acquaintances is the route im going
Having friendly competition between friends and acquaintances is a great way to add depth and realism to the dragons' society and culture. This can reflect a society where individuals are able to balance competition with cooperation and mutual respect. It also reinforces the friendly and social nature of the dragons and how they can maintain good relationships despite their competitive nature.

It's worth considering how this friendly competition manifests in the dragons' society and culture. Are there friendly competitions between dragons, such as races or hunting contests? Are these competitions organized by the government or are they more informal, organized by the dragons themselves?

It's also worth considering how this friendly competition would affect the dragons' relationships with other species. Would they be willing to include other species in their friendly competitions, or would they prefer to keep them separate? How would other species view these friendly competitions, would they be interested in participating or would they prefer to stay out of it?

It's also worth considering how these friendly competitions would be regulated, if at all. Would there be rules and regulations to ensure that the competition stays friendly and safe, or would it be more of a free-for-all?

Overall, having friendly competition between friends and acquaintances is a great way to add depth and realism to the dragons' society and culture while reinforcing their friendly and social nature. It can also create interesting opportunities for players to engage in social and cultural activities and to explore the dynamics of friendly competition.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think informal and inclusive, with flexible rules.
Having informal and inclusive friendly competitions with flexible rules is a great way to reflect the friendly and social nature of the dragons. This approach would allow for a lot of creative freedom and spontaneity in the competitions and it would encourage the dragons to come up with new and interesting ways to compete with each other.

It's worth considering how the other species would interact with these informal and inclusive friendly competitions. Would they be welcomed to participate or would they prefer to stay out of it? How would they feel about the flexible rules, would they find it refreshing or would they find it disorganized?

It's also worth considering how the dragons would feel about other species participating in their friendly competitions. Would they be welcoming of other species or would they prefer to keep it exclusive to dragons?

It's also worth considering how the society would react to these informal and inclusive friendly competitions. Would it be seen as a positive thing, something that brings the community together? Or would it be seen as something that could cause trouble, like fights and accidents?

Overall, having informal and inclusive friendly competitions with flexible rules is a great way to reflect the friendly and social nature of the dragons, and it can create interesting opportunities for players to engage in social and cultural activities and explore the dynamics of friendly competition. It would be important to also consider how other species and society would react to these competitions to make it feel more realistic.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think games and sports will be very inclusive of other species, who are welcome to play or not to play, but the humans redikes and kradeas would be accepted more because they are less cutthroat than the tsendels, who would often be kicked out for excessive competition
Having inclusive games and sports that welcome all species, but where certain species are more accepted is a good way to add depth and realism to the society. It reflects a society that values inclusivity but also recognizes that not all individuals or species have the same social norms and behaviors.

It's worth considering how these games and sports would be organized. Would they be organized by the government, by private organizations, or by the individuals themselves? How would these games and sports be funded, and who would have access to the facilities and equipment?

It's also worth considering how the different species would react to these games and sports. Would they all be interested in participating, or would some species prefer to stay out of it? How would the less competitive species feel about competing against the more competitive ones, and how would the more competitive species feel about playing with less competitive ones?

It's also worth considering how the society would view these games and sports. Would they be seen as a positive thing, bringing the community together and promoting understanding and cooperation among different species? Or would they be seen as a potential source of conflict, with different species having different attitudes towards competition and cooperation?

Overall, having inclusive games and sports that welcome all species, but where certain species are more accepted is a good way to add depth and realism to the society, but it is important to consider how the different species and society would react to these games and sports to make it feel more realistic.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think individuals hosting games would be the best option, and kradeas would prefer water sports, and tsendels prefer sports with some form of hunting, and redikes would be open to anything, i also just realized that dragons would have flying sports that other species would have a very hard time playing without a plane or glider of some sort.
Having individuals hosting games as the best option allows for a lot of creative freedom and spontaneity in the competitions and it would encourage different species to come up with new and interesting ways to compete with each other.

It's a good idea that Kradeas would prefer water sports, given that they have a crab-like appearance it's likely they have some aquatic adaptations. Tsendels would prefer sports with some form of hunting, since they are efficient hunter it would be something they would excel in. And redikes would be open to anything, they are likely physically strong and durable, they would be good at most physical activities.

It's also great point that dragons would have flying sports that other species would have a very hard time playing without a plane or glider of some sort. Flying sports would be unique to dragons and it would provide a different type of challenge for the other species who would be interested in participating.

It's also worth considering how these games and sports would be regulated, if at all. Would there be rules and regulations to ensure safety, or would it be more of a free-for-all? How would the society view these different types of sports and games, would they be accepted or would they be seen as too dangerous?

Overall, having individuals hosting games as the best option allows for a lot of creative freedom and spontaneity in the competitions and it would encourage different species to come up with new and interesting ways to compete with each other, it also allows you to incorporate the unique characteristics of the species, making the game and sports more interesting and fun.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about houses?
Houses can be an important aspect of any RPG, as they can provide a sense of place and belonging for the player and NPCs. The type of houses that different species would live in can depend on a variety of factors, including their physical characteristics, cultural norms, and available resources.

For example, Redikes would likely live in houses that accommodate for their tail and horns. They would also likely prefer houses made of natural materials such as wood or stone, as they have a semi-tribal culture.

Dragons, on the other hand, would likely have houses that are larger and taller to accommodate for their size and wings. They may also prefer houses made of fire-resistant materials, since they can breathe fire.

Kradeas would need houses with easy access to water, they might also have some sort of water filtration system and their homes may incorporate some form of humidity control.

Tsendels are underground creatures, their homes would likely be burrows or caves, they may also have underground irrigation and ventilation systems to accommodate for their underground habitat.

For humans, they would likely prefer houses with modern amenities and technology, and would also likely want to make their houses as comfortable and attractive as possible, they might also have different architectural styles based on the region they are from.

It's also worth considering how the different species would interact with each other in terms of housing. Would they live in mixed neighborhoods, or would they prefer to live in separate areas? How would interspecies relationships affect where people choose to live?

Overall, houses can be an important aspect of any RPG, as they can provide a sense of place and belonging for the player and NPCs. It is important to consider the unique characteristics of each species when designing their houses, as it will make the game more interesting and fun.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about interspecies relationships and hybrids?
Interspecies relationships and hybrids can be an interesting aspect of any RPG, as they add depth and complexity to the society. Depending on the setting and the species involved, interspecies relationships and hybrids can be viewed positively, negatively, or neutrally.

In your game, it appears that integration and interspecies relationships causing hybrids would be a good option. It could be interesting to see how different species react to hybrids, and how hybrids themselves view their own identity and place in society.

One possibility is that some species may view hybrids positively, as they could be seen as a symbol of unity and cooperation between different species. Other species may view hybrids negatively, as they could be seen as a threat to their own cultural or genetic purity.

Hybrids themselves may have a unique perspective on their own identity, and may feel like they don't fully fit in with either of their parent species. Some hybrids may lean more towards one parent species, and may identify more with that species, while others may identify more with both species.

It's also worth considering how hybrids would be treated legally and socially. Would they have the same rights and privileges as their parent species, or would they be treated differently? How would the government and society view and regulate interspecies relationships and hybrids?

Overall, interspecies relationships and hybrids can be an interesting aspect of any RPG, as they add depth and complexity to the society. It's important to consider the societal and cultural implications of interspecies relationships and hybrids, as well as how they would be treated legally and socially in order to make the game more realistic and immersive.

what worldbuilding aspects havent we covered?
There are many aspects of worldbuilding that we haven't covered yet, depending on the level of detail you want to include in your RPG. Some potential areas to consider include:

Religion: What religions and belief systems are present in the world? How do they shape the culture and society? How do different species view religion?

History: What is the history of the world? How did different species come to be? How have they interacted with each other throughout history? What important events have shaped the world?

Technology: You've mentioned the use of modern technology, but it's worth considering how advanced the technology is in different areas and how it differs from Earth. What new technologies have been developed? How does technology affect society?

Magic: Although you've mentioned that this RPG will have no magic, it's worth considering if there's any sort of supernatural or paranormal elements in the world.

Climate and environment: How does the climate and environment of the planet affect the different species and their societies? Are there any unique or unusual biomes? Are there any environmental problems or disasters?

Politics and government: You've touched on government and politics a bit, but it's worth considering in more detail. How do different species view politics and government? How do different countries and regions interact with each other? What are the key political issues and conflicts?

Economy: You've also touched on the economy a bit, but it's worth considering in more detail. What are the major industries and resources? How do different species contribute to and benefit from the economy? How does the economy affect society and politics?

Military: How are different species' militaries organized? What are the different branches? What kind of weapons and technology do they have? How do different species view war and conflict?

All of these are just examples and you can decide which elements you would like to add to your game to make it more interesting and immersive, but it is worth considering all of them to have a well rounded and believable world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
religion is similar to earths religion, history is mostly wars and major discoveries, technology is a few years ahead of earths, no magic, there should be graphite deserts and beaches and a lot of rainforests as well as springy grass that functions as a trampoline, yendels dont like government at all while redikes prefer a more primitive government and dragons dont care for government as much while kradeas like a strict regime, so we need to talk mostly about economy and military.
Sure, let's focus on the economy and military aspects of your RPG world.

Economy: Based on what you've said, it sounds like the economy of this world is primarily based on natural resources, particularly the unique biomes and resources found in the rainforests and graphite deserts. Additionally, it seems that different species have different strengths and contributions to the economy. For example, the Redikes may focus on hunting and gathering resources from the rainforests, the Dragons may focus on mining graphite and other minerals from the deserts, and the Kradeas may specialize in developing new technologies.

It's also worth considering how trade and commerce work between different species and countries. Are there any tariffs or trade barriers? Are there any major trade agreements or alliances? How do different species view trade and commerce? How does the economy affect society and politics?

Military: Based on what you've said, it sounds like the military of this world is organized differently between different species. The Redikes may have a more tribal and decentralized military, with different factions and chieftains having their own fighters, while the Kradeas may have a more centralized and technologically advanced military. The Dragons may have a smaller military but is heavily focused on air power and have a powerful airforce, meanwhile the Yendels are not interested in military at all.

It's also worth considering how different species view war and conflict. Are there any long-standing conflicts or rivalries? Are there any alliances or non-aggression pacts? How does the military affect society and politics?

It's important to keep in mind that these are just suggestions and you can decide how much details to include in your game and how to implement them. Keep in mind that all the elements of your game should be coherent and consistent with each other, to create a believable and immersive world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think the economy functions similarly to what you said, but redikes are more open to differing jobs and tsendels/yendels are skilled physical workers and hunters
That makes sense, with the Redikes being more adaptable and open to different types of jobs, while the Tsendels/Yendels have a natural advantage in physical labor and hunting.

It could be interesting to explore how this affects the different sectors of the economy. For example, the Tsendels/Yendels may dominate in manual labor jobs such as construction and logging, while the Redikes may excel in more diverse and dynamic roles such as trade and commerce. The dragons could be great in mining, and kradeas in technology.

It's also worth considering how the different species interact in the workforce. Are there any instances of discrimination or prejudice? Are there any laws or policies in place to address these issues? Are there any interspecies labor unions or worker's rights groups? How does the economy affect society and politics?

It could also be interesting to explore how different species view the concept of work and career, and how that affects the economy and society. For example, dragons may view work as a way to gain status and prestige, while the Redikes may view it as a means to support their families and communities.

Overall, the economy of your world sounds like it would be diverse, with different species contributing to different sectors of the economy and having different strengths and weaknesses.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
quick clarification, im sorry for the confusion coused by this, but tsendels and scourges are now just yendels
No problem, I understand now that "tsendel" and "scourge" are both different names for the same species, which you are now referring to as "yendels".

It's always important to clarify any confusion or inconsistencies in your world-building to ensure coherency and consistency in your game.

With that in mind, your economy still functions similarly as I previously mentioned, but with the Yendels being skilled physical workers and hunters, they may dominate in manual labor jobs such as construction and logging, and hunting.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yes
Great! It sounds like you have a good handle on the economy and different species' roles in it. The next step would be to consider how this affects the society and politics of your world. For example, how does the economy shape the different cultures and lifestyles of the different species? How does it affect relations between different species and countries? How does it impact social mobility and class distinctions?

It could also be worth considering how the economy is impacted by outside factors such as natural disasters, disease, and war. How does the government respond to these issues and how does it affect the economy? How do the different species respond to economic downturns and recessions?

It's also important to think about how the economy interacts with other aspects of your world, such as the military, technology, and religion. How does the economy shape these factors and how do they shape the economy?

Overall, economy plays a big part in shaping the world and its inhabitants, and it's important to consider its various interactions and implications to help create a rich and believable world for your RPG.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
we should talk military now
Yes, the military is an important aspect of any world, especially in a fantasy RPG where there may be various threats and conflicts to address.

To start, it's important to consider the different species and their natural strengths and weaknesses. For example, dragons may be fierce fighters with powerful fire breath, while the yendels may be skilled hunters and trackers. The kradeas may be technologically advanced and able to operate advanced machinery or robots. And the redikes may be skilled at mounted combat and archery.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses of each species can help you to create unique and interesting military units. For example, dragons may be elite aerial units, while yendels may be scouts and special forces. The kradeas may operate advanced tanks and aircraft, while the redikes may be skilled archers and cavalry.

It's also important to consider the different cultures and societies of the different species. For example, dragons may have a strong warrior culture and value honor and glory in battle, while the redikes may view warfare as a necessary evil to protect their families and communities. Yendels may be more solitary and not care as much for military life, and kradeas may be more technologically advanced and have a lot of robots and drones in their army.

It's also worth considering how the different species interact within the military. Are there any instances of discrimination or prejudice? Are there any interspecies units or integrated units? How does the military shape society and politics? How does it affect relations between different species and countries?

Overall, the military of your world sounds like it would be diverse, with different species contributing to different roles and having different strengths and weaknesses. It also plays a big part in shaping the world and its inhabitants, and it's important to consider its various interactions and implications to help create a rich and believable world for your RPG.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
my idea on their opinions is that dragons fight for freedom and to get things, redikes fight only if they have to, yendels fight because of the adrenaline and honor, and kradeas fight as long as they get something out of it.
That's a great idea, it allows for a diverse representation of the species and their opinions on military.

Dragons fighting for freedom and to gain things aligns with the idea that they have a strong warrior culture and value honor and glory in battle.

Redikes fighting only if they have to, aligns with the idea that they view warfare as a necessary evil to protect their families and communities.

Yendels fighting for adrenaline and honor aligns with the idea that they are skilled hunters and trackers, and may enjoy the thrill of battle.

Kradeas fighting as long as they get something out of it aligns with the idea that they may be more pragmatic and technologically advanced, and may be more focused on the benefits and resources that come from war.

It would be important to consider how these attitudes towards military affects the society and politics of the different species and how it affects relations between different species and countries. It could also be interesting to see how these attitudes change over time and how the different species adapt to new situations and challenges.

It's important to keep in mind that these general attitudes could vary among individuals within the species, and not all dragons, redikes, yendels or kradeas would have the same opinion on warfare. It's also good to think about how these attitudes would change depending on the specific conflict they are facing.

Overall, it's great that you have a clear idea on how different species would view military, this will help to make your world more believable and diverse.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i want to discuss the skills each species would provide in war, for example, i like the idea of redikes being archers and cavalry.
That's a great idea, each species having their own set of skills and abilities can add a lot of depth and realism to your world and its military.

Redikes being skilled archers and cavalry makes sense given their physical characteristics. Their horns and tail would provide natural armor and weapons, and their height and speed would make them well suited for mounted combat. They could also be skilled in using crossbows, which would be a more technologically advanced option for them.

Dragons could be elite aerial units, able to fly and use their powerful fire breath as weapons. They could also be skilled in hand-to-hand combat, using their strong jaws, claws and tail as weapons.

Yendels are skilled hunters and trackers, they could be used as scouts and special forces. Their speed, agility and keen sense of smell would be great assets for reconnaissance and tracking.

Kradeas being technologically advanced, they could operate advanced machinery or robots. They could use their advanced technology to make up for their lack of physical strength and speed. They could also use their advanced technology to control the battlefield from a distance.

It's also worth considering how these abilities would change depending on the specific conflict they are facing. For example, in a jungle, a yendel would be a great asset for tracking, but in a desert, a dragon would be better suited for reconnaissance.

It's also important to consider how these abilities would be incorporated into different units and tactics. For example, a cavalry unit made up of redikes and dragons could be very effective, with the dragons providing air support and the redikes providing ground support.

Overall, it's great that you have a clear idea of the skills each species would provide in war, it helps to create a believable and diverse military that can be an important part of your world and story.

what colors should redikes dragons and kradeas be?
The colors of your species can be a great way to give them visual distinction and make them stand out.

For Redikes, you could consider a variety of colors and patterns that would reflect their reptilian nature. For example, you could have them be primarily green with dark brown or black stripes, or have a red or orange coloration with black spots. You could also incorporate other colors, such as blue or yellow to make them more vibrant and interesting.

For Dragons, you could consider colors that would make them look fierce and powerful. For example, you could have them be primarily black or dark grey with red or orange underbelly, or a metallic silver and gold colors. You could also incorporate other colors such as dark purple or deep blue to make them more unique.

For Kradeas, you could consider colors that would reflect their aquatic nature, maybe a dark blue or green color with some white or yellow spots, or a light grey color with some black spots as well.

It's worth noting that colors in animals are often determined by genetics, so you could also have different families or subspecies of each species with different colors.

Additionally, it's also worth considering that colors can also have a symbolic meaning in your world, and that could play a role in how different races and cultures perceive them.

i like the idea for kradea coloration, but i think dragons and redikes should have a very wide variety.
That's a great idea! Having a wide variety of colors for dragons and redikes would make them more interesting and unique.

For example, you could have dragons with metallic scales that come in a variety of hues such as silver, gold, copper, and bronze. You could also have redikes with different shades of green, brown, and orange, with different patterns such as stripes, spots, or blotches.

Additionally, you could also incorporate different variations in the texture of the scales, such as smooth, glossy, or rough scales. This could add more depth and realism to the dragons and redikes, and make them feel more like actual living creatures.

You could also have different subspecies of each species that have specific colors or patterns, and that could be associated with different regions, or have different characteristics or behaviors.

Overall, the more details and variations you have for your species, the more believable and interesting they will be.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like that
I'm glad you find it helpful! Remember that as the creator, you have the freedom to decide on the colors and patterns that best fit your vision for your species. These ideas are here to help you build a more interesting and believable world, but ultimately you have the final say on what will be included in your game.

If you have any more questions or want to expand on some aspect of your world, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to help.

should the dragons have ears?
Dragons in fantasy literature and media are often depicted as having large, expressive ears, which can be a great way to give them more character and personality. It also allows them to express more emotions and convey more information to other characters and players.

On the other hand, not having ears would also be an interesting design choice and would make them more unique and different from other fantasy creatures.

You could also consider a different type of hearing organ, such as a row of small ear-like structures along their jawline or a different type of sense organ altogether.

It's all up to you and what fits best with your vision for the dragons in your game. Remember that you can always come back and make changes later on if you decide to.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think that more war prone subspecies will have the small rows of ear holes like you mentioned, while calmer subspecies will have ears so that they can express more emotion.
That's a great idea! Having different subspecies of dragons with different physical characteristics based on their behavior or role in the society is a great way to add depth and realism to your world.

Having certain subspecies with small rows of ear holes that are more war-prone and others with larger, expressive ears that are more peaceful would make them feel more like actual living creatures with different behaviors and characteristics. It also gives players more options to choose from and can make the game more interesting.

Keep in mind that having different subspecies with different characteristics can also have an impact on their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to think about how it will affect the gameplay.

Also, you may consider the reason why some subspecies became more war-prone, maybe they evolved to protect their territory or resources, or because of some historical events that led to their aggressive behavior.

Remember, the more details and variations you have for your species, the more believable and interesting they will be.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how should redike dragon kradea and yendel culture function?
Each species' culture should be unique and reflect their characteristics, history, and behaviors.

For example:

Redike culture could be semi-tribal, with a strong emphasis on family and community. They may have a strong warrior tradition and value physical strength and bravery. They may also place a high value on honor, loyalty, and respect for their elders. They could have a rich oral tradition and storytelling culture, passed down through generations.

Dragon culture could be highly individualistic and competitive, with a strong emphasis on personal strength and achievement. They may have a deep understanding of time and history, and a strong interest in the arts and sciences. They could also have a strong sense of tradition and respect for their ancestors.

Kradea culture could be highly technologically advanced, with a strong emphasis on problem-solving and innovation. They may place a high value on efficiency and practicality, and have a strong tradition of scientific and engineering research. They could also have a strong sense of community and cooperation, given the importance of survival in their harsh living conditions.

Yendel culture could be more solitary, based on their nomadic and solitary nature, they may value independence and self-sufficiency. They may have a strong connection to nature and a deep understanding of the natural world. They may also have a strong tradition of hunting and tracking. They could also have a strong sense of honor and respect for the natural balance of life and death.

It's important to note that cultures are constantly evolving, so you could also consider how the different cultures are changing over time, whether it be due to new technologies, conflicts, or integration with other cultures.

You can also think about how different subcultures and groups within each species might have different values, beliefs, and customs. This can add more depth and richness to your world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like the idea of cooperatio and family values for the dragons and redikes, i also think that dragons and redikes should have a lot of music
That sounds like a great idea! Having a strong emphasis on music in dragon and redike culture could add a lot of depth and richness to their cultures.

Incorporating music into their culture could reflect their values and beliefs. For example, dragons may use music as a way to express their individualism and personal strength, while redikes may use music as a way to strengthen their community bonds and express their shared values and beliefs.

You could also think about how different types of music might be associated with different aspects of their culture, such as traditional folk music for storytelling, or epic orchestral pieces to reflect the dragon's love of grandeur and tradition.

Another idea is that dragons and redikes use music as a way of communicating with one another. They could have a complex system of musical language that is used to convey emotions, thoughts and ideas.

You could also think about how music is taught, who is allowed to learn and play it, and how it is performed. For example, playing music could be a rite of passage for young dragons, or it could be a skill passed down through the generations in a redike family.

All in all, music is a powerful tool to reflect and express the culture and values of your species, it is a great idea to incorporate it in the game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about social conventions and what different species find attractive?
Different species in your game could have very different social conventions and what they find attractive.

For example, dragons may value strength and power in their partners, and place a high premium on physical prowess. They may also have a strong emphasis on courtship rituals, such as displaying their strength and abilities to potential partners.

Redikes, on the other hand, may value community and cooperation in their relationships, and place a high premium on the ability to work well with others. They may also have a strong emphasis on family and the raising of children.

Kradeas may value intelligence and adaptability in their partners, and may place a high premium on their partners ability to solve problems and think creatively.

Yendels may value independence and self-sufficiency in their partners, and may place a high premium on their partners ability to survive on their own.

It's also possible that interspecies relationships and hybrids may be viewed differently by different cultures. For example, some cultures may be more accepting of them while others may view them with suspicion or mistrust.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just examples, and you have a lot of creative freedom to develop social conventions and attractiveness that fit with the unique characteristics of your species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like all of those ideas
I'm glad you find them useful! Creating a rich and detailed fantasy world with unique cultures and social conventions can be a lot of fun and add depth to your RPG. Remember that you have a lot of creative freedom to develop these aspects of your world in a way that works best for your game. If you have any more questions or need further help, feel free to ask!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what styles of music do you think different species would enjoy
Different species in your game could have very different tastes in music.

For example, dragons may enjoy music that is loud, powerful, and energetic, such as heavy metal or hard rock. They may also enjoy music that showcases their physical abilities, such as percussion-heavy music.

Redikes, on the other hand, may enjoy music that is harmonious and melodic, such as folk music or bluegrass. They may also place a high value on group performance and enjoy music that is played by a band or ensemble.

Kradeas may enjoy music that is experimental and avant-garde, such as electronic or ambient music. They may also enjoy music that is complex and layered, with many different instruments and sounds.

Yendels may enjoy music that is raw and primal, such as punk or heavy blues. They may also enjoy music that is percussive, such as drumming or marching band music.

It's also possible that different cultures within a species may have different tastes in music. For example, some dragons may prefer traditional music, while others may prefer modern pop music.

Again, these are just examples, and you have a lot of creative freedom to develop the musical tastes of your species in a way that works best for your game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think , in general of course since different individuals would have different preferences, but dragons would likely enjoy orchestra as well
Yes, that's a great point. Dragons may enjoy orchestral music, especially if it is grand and epic in nature, as it can showcase their size and power. They may also enjoy music that showcases the range of their vocal abilities, such as opera or choral music.

The idea of dragons having a symphonic band with different sections for different instruments is a great concept as well, that would fit with their love for music, and also their culture of friendly competition.

It's also possible that dragons would appreciate the complexity and precision that orchestral music requires, as it could reflect their highly intelligent nature.

As i said before, remember that you have a lot of creative freedom to develop the musical tastes of your species in a way that works best for your game and story.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yes i agree with all of that it is almost as if you can read my mind
I'm glad you like the ideas. As a language model AI, I can make predictions and suggestions based on the information provided to me, but I don't have a mind of my own. I'm just using patterns in the information provided to make suggestions. Is there anything else I can help you with?




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about habits and other quirks of the different species?
Habits and quirks can be a great way to add depth and personality to your different species. It can also help to make them feel more distinct from one another.

For example, dragons may have a habit of hoarding treasure or other valuable items, reflecting their love for material possessions. They might also have a quirk of being easily excited by shiny or glittering objects.

Redikes, as semi-tribal reptilian humanoids, may have a habit of marking their territory with scent or physical markings, this reflecting their strong territorial nature. They might also have a quirk of being particularly sensitive to changes in temperature.

Kradeas, with their unique physiology, could have a habit of communicating through their pheromones, making them difficult to understand for other species that don't have the ability to read pheromones. They may also have a quirk of being particularly sensitive to light, because of their large eye.

Yendels, being a solitary and efficient hunter, could have a habit of hunting in silence, and have a quirk of being particularly stealthy.

Remember that you can always adjust, add or remove the quirk you think would fit better with the story and gameplay.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like those, and i also think that kradeas will have a habit of whitsling through their breathing holes and walking sideways, and dragons would not like the cold or dark, and redikes would run everywhere since they are faster than other species, and yendels would dislike light as well because of their underground natural habitat.
Those are some interesting ideas for the habits and quirks of the different species. It can add some unique characteristics to the different species, making them stand out and be more memorable for players. Another thing you could consider is how each species would react to certain situations or emotions, for example, how do dragons react to stress or anger? How do Redikes react to danger or surprise? etc. It will help to give them more depth, and make them feel more like real beings.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yes we should talk about expressions and emotions now
Yes, expressions and emotions can play a big role in making the different species feel more realistic and relatable. Each species can have their own unique ways of expressing themselves and showing emotions. For example, dragons may have more subtle and complex expressions, while Redikes may have more exaggerated and physical expressions.
Yendels may have a more stoic expression, but have a unique way of showing fear or anger. Kradeas may have a unique way of showing happiness or sadness as well.
You could also consider how each species processes and experiences emotions, for example, dragons may be more reserved and internal with their emotions, while Redikes may be more open and expressive. Yendels may be more unpredictable or stoic in their emotions, and Kradeas may be more analytical or logical in their emotions.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like that but maybe dragons should be expressive as well, and also, what is there to improve?
Yes, dragons can certainly be expressive as well. In fact, it could be interesting to explore the idea that dragons have a wide range of expressions and emotions, but they are also very good at hiding them when they want to.

As for what can be improved, it really depends on what you want to focus on for your game. Some things you might want to consider are:

Developing the cultures of each species in more detail, including their beliefs, customs, and values.
Exploring the different environments and ecosystems of the planet and how they impact the different species.
Further developing the economy and government systems of the planet and how they function.
Creating more detailed and unique characters for the different species, with their own personalities, goals, and motivations.
Adding more depth and nuance to the interactions and relationships between the different species.
Creating more detailed and unique weapons and equipment for each species.
Exploring the impact of technology and artificial intelligence on the planet and its inhabitants.
These are just a few examples of what you can do to further develop your world, but the possibilities are really endless. Ultimately, the most important thing is to have fun and be creative while you build your game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think more species would be good, but i dont know where to start.
When it comes to adding more species to your fantasy RPG, it can be helpful to think about the different roles they might play in the game's world. For example, you could add a species that is skilled in stealth and espionage, or a species that is particularly adept at magic or psionics. You could also consider adding a species that is known for its great physical strength or endurance.

Another aspect to consider is the environment where this species would live in. Do they live in the forest, underground, in the mountains, in the water? This will give you an idea of what this species might look like, and what adaptations they might have to survive in their environment.

It could also be interesting to think about how this new species fits into the existing society and politics of the game's world. Are they welcomed as equals, or are they discriminated against? Are they a major player in the game's economy, or do they live in poverty?

Overall, when creating a new species, it is important to think about how they will fit into the game's world, what kind of role they will play, and how they will interact with the other species that are already present.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
should dragons walk bipedally, quadrupedally, or both?
That would depend on the design you have in mind for the dragons in your game. If you want them to have a more traditional, Western dragon appearance, they may be more likely to walk bipedally, using their wings to balance. If you want them to have a more Eastern dragon appearance, they may be quadrupedal and use their wings for flying. Alternatively, you could design them to be able to walk both bipedally and quadrupedally, giving them greater versatility in movement and potentially making them more interesting characters in your game. Ultimately, the decision is yours and will depend on the overall aesthetic and functionality you want for your dragons.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think they will walk bipedally when they can, but if they're tired or they don't have much room or if they just don't feel like standing up they will walk quadrupedally.
That makes sense, as it would give dragons more versatility in their movement and allow them to adapt to different environments or situations. Another aspect to consider is that dragons might use their wings to help them balance when walking on two legs, and their tails for balance when walking on four legs. Additionally, you could also consider how different subspecies of dragons might have different preferred modes of movement, depending on their environment or lifestyle.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yes
Great! It sounds like you have a lot of interesting and well thought out ideas for your fantasy RPG world. The different species you've created each have their own unique characteristics, cultures, and behaviors, which will add a lot of depth and variety to the game. Additionally, the inclusion of modern technology and the absence of magic gives the game a unique spin on the fantasy genre.

It's also good to keep in mind that as you're developing your game, you should be testing and playtesting it to ensure that it's fun and enjoyable for players. You may also want to consider getting feedback from others to see how they respond to the game and make adjustments accordingly.

I hope this information helps you as you continue to develop your RPG. If you have any other questions or need further help, don't hesitate to ask!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how should the different species facial expressions and body language vary?
Facial expressions and body language can vary greatly between species, as different species have evolved different ways of communicating and expressing themselves. For example, dragons may have more expressive faces and use larger gestures, as they are larger and more physically imposing than other species. They may also use more vocalizations, such as roars or growls, to convey emotions. Redikes may have more subtle facial expressions, but use their tails and horns to communicate and express themselves. They may also rely more on scent to communicate emotions. Kradeas may have a more limited range of facial expressions due to their lack of a mouth, but use their eye and body language to communicate. Yendels may have a more stoic expression and rely on their pheromones to communicate emotions. It would be important to keep in mind that individuals can also have their own expressions and body language habits.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like all of those ideas. what do you think yendels should communicate with other than pheromones since they cannot blink and do not have much in the way of a face or an ability to speak?
Yendels could communicate through a variety of ways, depending on the specific characteristics you've given them. Since they are quadrupedal, they could communicate through body language and movements, such as changes in posture or tail position. They might also use vocalizations like growls, snarls, or clicks to convey different emotions or messages. Some species that live underground might also use echolocation, like bats, to communicate. They might also use scent marking to communicate as well.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like the clicks idea
That's great! It's a unique and fitting way for the yendels to communicate, as it allows them to convey information without the use of traditional facial expressions or speech. It also fits with their underground habitat, as sound can travel well through solid rock. Additionally, it would add an interesting layer of complexity to interactions between the yendels and other species, as non-yendels would need to learn to understand their clicks in order to communicate with them effectively.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i also think a universal sign language would be good, especially for yendels who have four hands.
Yes, a universal sign language could be a useful way for the different species to communicate with one another, especially for species like the yendels who have difficulty with verbal communication. Additionally, it could also be used in situations where verbal communication is difficult or impossible, such as in loud environments or underwater. Another possibility could be using technology to help facilitate communication, such as using translation devices or text-to-speech software.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
should dragons walk bipedally, quadrupedally, or both?
I previously mentioned that dragons can walk both bipedally and quadrupedally, depending on the situation or their personal preference. They may prefer to stand on two legs when they are in social or formal settings, while they may switch to four legs when they are tired or in tight spaces. Additionally, they may also use their wings to balance while walking on two legs, especially if they are carrying something or using tools. They would be capable of using tools with their paws as well as their mouth.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
oh yes i just forgot thank you
You're welcome! It's important to consider different aspects of the different species you're creating and how they interact with each other and the world. It's a lot of fun to create your own unique world with unique species and cultures. Let me know if there's anything else you need help with.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what sports should they play?
That would depend on the capabilities and physical attributes of each species. For example, dragons might excel at flying sports or sports that involve using their wings and/or fire breath, while kradeas would likely excel at water sports due to their crab-like legs and affinity for water. Redikes would likely excel at running and jumping sports because of their speed and agility. Yendels could be skilled at hunting and tracking-based sports or underground sports that involve navigating through caves or tunnels. Humans would likely excel at a wide variety of sports, since they are versatile and adaptable. It might also be interesting to explore interspecies sports or games that involve cooperation and teamwork between different species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what games would require cooperation and between what species?
There are many sports and games that could require cooperation between different species. Some examples include:

Mixed-species relay races, where each team member is a different species and they must work together to pass a baton or other object between them.
Group hunting or scavenger hunts, where members of different species must work together to find and capture a target or collect a set of items.
Puzzle or problem-solving games, where members of different species must use their unique abilities and strengths to solve a challenge or complete a task.
Cooperative sports like soccer or basketball, where players of different species must work together to outscore the opposing team.
Rope or net climbing, where different species would use their unique abilities to help the team reach the top
These are just a few examples, but there are many other possibilities depending on the abilities and strengths of the different species in your world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
could you write a detailed description of each species so i know were on the same page?
Sure, here is a summary of the main characteristics and traits of each species:

Dragons: Large, quadrupedal creatures that can walk on two legs as well. They have a fierce and competitive personality and are covered in scales. They have a lifespan of around 150 years, and are omnivorous, preferring meat. They have small rows of ear holes and are very friendly and social. They are intelligent and great at business ownership. They enjoy music and play large brass instruments and piano.

Redikes: Tall, bipedal creatures with a more primitive government. They have a tail and horns, and are covered in scales. They are omnivorous, with a preference for fruit. They are independent and open to different jobs. They enjoy music and play string instruments.

Kradeas: Bipedal creatures with two crab-like legs and mouths on their hands. They have a large, rectangular eye, and a tail with breathing holes. They are technologically advanced, and have a strict regime. They are algaivores and need lots of sodium. They enjoy water sports.

Yendels: They are also called Tsendels, they are subterranean creatures with multiple mandibles, and a tail with breathing holes. They are solitary and do not like government at all. They are opportunistic eaters and enjoy hunting and sports. They communicate through pheromones and clicks.

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
great! the only thing is that yendels do not have breathing holes on their tail, they have spiracles near their head, im not sure i mentioned that.
​




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
great! the only thing is that yendels do not have breathing holes on their tail, they have spiracles near their head, im not sure i mentioned that.
I apologize for the confusion, I will make sure to include that detail in my descriptions of the Yendels from now on. To summarize, the Yendels are a quadrupedal species with multiple mandibles and a large, rectangular eye. They have a hard exoskeleton for protection and use pheromones as a primary method of communication. They are skilled hunters and physical workers, and are known for their fierce competitive nature in sports and games. Yendels also have spiracles near their head to breathe instead of breathing holes on their tail.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think youre getting confused with the kradeas, yendels have small crystal eyes
I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that yendels have small crystal eyes and do not have breathing holes on their tail or anywhere else on their body. They instead have a system of internal gills that allow them to breathe. They also have multiple mandibles which they use to make their clicking vocalizations and to play musical instruments. They are skilled physical workers and hunters, and they have a strong sense of honor and enjoy the adrenaline of combat. They are not fond of government and tend to be independent. They are able to see in the dark due to their eyes being able to detect infrared radiation, and they are subterranean creatures that dislike bright light.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
great! the only thing is that yendels do not have breathing holes on their tail, they have spiracles near their head, im not sure i mentioned that. its actually the kradeas with internal gills.
I apologize for any confusion, I understand now that it is the kradeas that have internal gills and breathing holes on their tail, and yendels have small crystal eyes. Is there anything else that needs to be corrected or added to the descriptions of each species?




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
no, thats all, you seem to understand them well.
I'm glad I could help you with that! It sounds like you have a detailed and complex world built with many interesting and unique species. It's important to have a clear understanding of the characteristics and abilities of each species in order to create believable and consistent stories set in that world. If you have any more questions or need further help, please let me know.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about accents? since kradeas talk through tiny breathing holes, and redikes and dragons dont have lips.
Accents can be a difficult concept for certain species, especially those without lips or traditional vocal cords. For kradeas, their speech may be affected by the size and shape of their breathing holes, which could result in a unique accent. Redikes and dragons, on the other hand, may have different vocal mechanisms altogether, such as using vibrations in their throat or chest to create speech. This could also result in unique accents. Additionally, different subspecies of dragons and redikes might have variations in their speech patterns, much like different dialects within a human culture.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i was already thinking dragons could have an extra set of vocal cords. what about the pitch of different species voices?
That's a great idea. The pitch of different species' voices could vary depending on their anatomy and physiology. For example, dragons might have deeper, more resonant voices due to their larger size and lung capacity. Redikes might have higher-pitched voices because of their smaller size and different vocal cords. Kradeas might have a unique, whistling or chirping quality to their voice because of the way they produce sound through their breathing holes. Yendels might have a more guttural, clicking or hissing voice because of their lack of vocal cords. Overall, different species might have distinct accent and intonation patterns as well, depending on their culture and language.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like that, thats what i was thinking already, but maybe yendels could have primitive vocal cords for growling.
That's an interesting idea. It's possible that yendels could have developed a way to make vocalizations through other means, such as through the use of air sacs or specialized muscles. It could also be that they rely on body language and pheromones for communication, and vocalizations are not a necessary component of their communication system. Ultimately, it depends on how you envision the yendel species and their biology.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yeah maybe a rattler
That's an interesting idea, having yendels have a rattle-like sound in their vocalizations. It could add an extra layer of uniqueness to their species and also serve as a warning or communication method. It could also be a characteristic of a certain subspecies of yendel, depending on the type of environment they live in and what kind of adaptations they've developed.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
Is there any major improvements you think we should make?
It's hard for me to say without more context, but overall it seems like you've put a lot of thought into the different species and their characteristics, and how they would interact with each other. One suggestion would be to consider how the different species' characteristics, cultures, and societies might have evolved over time, and how they might continue to evolve in the future. Additionally, you may want to think about how the different species' abilities and limitations would impact their technology, architecture, and infrastructure.
It might also be interesting to consider how the different species would handle death and bereavement and how it would differ from one species to another. You may also want to think about how the different species would handle different kinds of conflicts, such as disputes over resources, territory, or beliefs.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about problems and flaws? any constructive critisism?
As a language model AI, I do not have a physical form, so it's difficult for me to have preferences or opinions on specific topics, but I can tell you that as far as world building goes, it's important to consider potential problems and flaws in the society you're creating. One potential issue that could arise in your world is how different species interact with one another and how they would handle conflicts or prejudice. It's also important to consider how different species would adapt to living in close proximity to one another and how their cultures and societies might evolve as a result. Additionally, it would be good to think about the ecological impact of having multiple intelligent species sharing a single planet and how that might affect the planet's biodiversity. These are just a few examples, but it's important to consider as many possible issues as you can in order to create a believable and well-rounded world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how about we work on different races in species, and how they are different in different biomes and areas.
Sure, that sounds like a great idea. Different biomes and areas can have an impact on the evolution and adaptations of a species, leading to variations within the species. For example, a redike living in a desert region may have evolved to have thicker scales for protection against the sun and heat, while a redike living in a forest region may have evolved to have more camouflage and stealth abilities to hunt in the dense foliage. Similarly, dragons living near a volcano may have evolved to be able to withstand high temperatures and even have fire-based abilities, while dragons living in a colder climate may have evolved to have thicker scales and the ability to breathe ice.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think that for dragons and redikes near the poles, white pupils to protect against snow blindness, and small horns and tails to conserve heat would be common, while near the equator the opposite would be true, those living near deserts would have smaller eyes and nostrils to keep sand out, near the water they would have more webbing and smoother scales, and in the forest they would have thinner and stronger bodies for moving around and hunting. any other biomes that we should cover? and there is also the different ways different species would adapt.
That's a great idea. Another biome to consider would be mountainous regions. For example, dragons living in mountainous regions might have larger wings to help them navigate the winds and thermals, and stronger leg muscles for climbing and holding on to steep terrain. Redikes living in mountainous regions might have longer horns to help them navigate narrow passes and defend themselves from predators. Kradeas living in mountainous regions might have a more rugged exoskeleton to protect them from falls and sharp rocks. Yendels living in mountainous regions might have thicker armor to protect them from falling rocks and boulders.

Another aspect to consider would be the different subspecies and races within each species. For example, some redikes might be larger and more aggressive, while others are smaller and more docile. Some dragons might have more colorful scales, while others have more muted colors. Some Kradeas might be better adapted to freshwater environments, while others are better suited for saltwater environments. Some Yendels might be better hunters, while others are better at building and crafting.

Overall, there are many different ways that the different species and races can be adapted to different biomes and environments, and it would be interesting to explore these different variations and how they might affect the culture, lifestyle and behavior of the different species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yes, now we should work on subspecies, and also, just something i would like to note, not all dragons have fire, and those who do usually have small amounts, it is somewhat rare to find dragons with immense fire capabilities.
Sure, that makes sense. In terms of subspecies, it could be interesting to explore how the different biomes and environments that you mentioned earlier would lead to the development of distinct subspecies within each species. For example, dragons that live in the forested areas could have thinner, more agile bodies and longer tails for maneuvering through the trees, while those that live in the desert might have larger nostrils and thicker scales to protect against the heat. Similarly, kradeas that live near the coast might have larger gills and fins for swimming, while those that live in the mountains might have thicker exoskeletons to protect against the cold.

As for the subspecies of redikes, it could be interesting to explore how they might have different hunting styles, depending on the environment they live in. For example, those that live in the forest might have longer horns and stronger legs for charging through underbrush, while those that live in the desert might have sharper claws and teeth for catching small, fast-moving prey.

With yendels, it could be interesting to explore how different subspecies might have adapted to different underground environments. For example, those that live in limestone caves might have stronger jaws and teeth for breaking through rock, while those that live in salt mines might have specialized glands for filtering out salt.

Overall, there are many possibilities for exploring subspecies within the different species, and it could be interesting to see how the different physical and behavioral adaptations that arise as a result of living in different environments.

what about making a biome that doesn't exist, like spring grass fields?
Sure, creating a unique biome can be a fun and creative way to add diversity to your world. In the case of spring grass fields, you could imagine an area with thick, bouncy grass that is resilient to heavy foot traffic. The grass itself would be a vibrant green, and would be able to support a wide variety of plant and animal life. The fields could be surrounded by a forest or other type of vegetation, and would likely be a popular destination for herbivores and other creatures looking to graze. For species that live in this biome, they would need to be able to adapt to this environment, like having strong legs to move on the springy ground, or to be able to jump higher. It's always fun to create new and unique biomes, and it can also add new challenges and opportunities for the different species in your world.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what other unique biomes could there be?
There are many potential unique biomes that you could include in your world. Here are a few examples:

Volcanic regions: These areas could have intense heat and ash-covered landscapes, with unique plant and animal life adapted to survive in the harsh conditions.

Tidal zones: These areas would be influenced by the tide and would have salt marshes and mangrove forests.

Subterranean: This biome would be underground and could include limestone caves, deep mines, and underground rivers, as well as unique species that have adapted to living in complete darkness.

Artificial: This biome would be created by intelligent species and could include things like cities, underground bunkers, and space stations.

Sky: This biome would be in the upper atmosphere or in space and could include floating islands, airships, and space stations.

Alien: This biome would be on another planet or moon, and could include completely different forms of life and environments that we can't even imagine on Earth.

These are just a few examples, but the possibilities are endless. Let your imagination run wild!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
cool
Yes, that sounds interesting. There could be a variety of other unique biomes, such as a volcanic area with lava lakes and geysers, or a dense jungle with towering trees and a diverse array of plants and animals. Another idea could be a deep sea biome with bioluminescent creatures and unique adaptations for deep sea pressure and lack of light. Another idea could be a floating islands biome, where the land masses are actually clusters of buoyant plants and animals that drift in the sky. The possibilities are endless!




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what do we need now?
It sounds like we've covered a lot of ground in terms of creating the different species, their characteristics, and how they adapt to different biomes and environments. Some other things to consider might be:

How the different species interact with one another and form societies
The role of technology in this world and how it differs from Earth
The history and politics of this planet, including any conflicts or major events that have shaped the current state of the world
Religion, if it exists, and how it varies between the different species
The economy and trade between different societies
Any unique flora and fauna that exist in this world and how they interact with the different species
Any natural disasters or extreme weather patterns that occur on this planet.
These are just a few suggestions, but there's certainly a lot more that could be explored in this world you've created.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how about we work on them in order, starting with species interacting and society.
Sure, that sounds like a good plan. We can start by discussing how the different species interact with one another in society. This could include things like interspecies relationships and marriages, as well as any potential biases or prejudices that may exist between different groups. We can also discuss how the different species divide up labor and roles within society, and how their unique physical and mental characteristics affect their interactions with one another.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
alright lets start with interspecies relationship, marriage, and interactions.
Sure, when it comes to interspecies relationships and marriage, it's important to consider the cultural and societal attitudes towards it in your world. Some societies may be more accepting of interspecies relationships, while others may not be as open to the idea. Additionally, the biological compatibility of different species should also be taken into account. For example, it might be difficult for a dragon and a redike to have children together because of their vastly different physiology.

In terms of interactions between different species, it would also depend on the societal attitudes and past experiences. For example, if there has been a history of conflict between two species, there may be tension and mistrust in their interactions. On the other hand, if different species have a history of cooperation and trade, their interactions may be more positive and friendly.

It's worth noting that there would also be different levels of interaction between individuals within the same species, and different individuals within different species. There will likely be individuals who don't mind interacting with other species, and others who would prefer to avoid it. Some individuals would be very open to interspecies relationships, while others would not.

So in general, the dynamics of interspecies relationships and interactions would be shaped by a variety of factors such as cultural attitudes, past experiences, and individual preferences.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
now lets tackle racism and societal roles.
Sure, when it comes to interspecies relationships, marriage, and interactions, it's important to consider the cultural and societal norms and attitudes of each species towards interspecies relationships. Some species may be more open to the idea and have a more accepting attitude towards interspecies relationships, while others may be more resistant or even discriminatory towards them.

When it comes to racism, it's important to note that it can manifest in different ways among the different species. For example, some species may discriminate based on physical characteristics or abilities, while others may discriminate based on cultural or societal differences. It's also important to consider how each species may have been affected by past conflicts or interactions with other species, as this may influence their attitudes and perceptions towards other species.

Societal roles for each species should also be taken into account. Some species may have traditional or prescribed roles in their society, such as warriors or leaders, while others may have more flexible or diverse roles. It's also important to consider how each species' abilities and characteristics may influence their societal roles and how they are perceived by others in their society.

In general, it will be important to consider the different ways that species interact and how they perceive each other in order to build a believable and diverse society.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
ok now technology
Sure, technology can be a big aspect of any world. In your world, with the presence of different species, it would be interesting to explore how the different species approach technology and how they use it in their daily lives. For example, kradeas may have a more technologically advanced society due to their need to adapt to living underwater. Similarly, yendels may have developed unique technologies to help them navigate their underground homes. It would also be interesting to explore how different species interact with human technology and how they've adapted it to their own needs. Additionally, you could consider the ethical implications of certain technologies, such as the use of robots or artificial intelligence in society.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
lets do it one species at a time, starting with redikes.
Sure, that sounds like a good plan. For the redikes, I imagine they would be quick to adapt to new technologies, especially those that would improve their hunting and survival capabilities. They would also be skilled at working with natural materials, such as wood and plant fibers, and could incorporate these materials into their technology. Their technology would likely be focused on practicality and function over aesthetics. They may also have a strong tradition of storytelling and oral history, so technologies such as recording devices would be important to them.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
ok now dragons.
For dragons, they could have a strong focus on technology related to flight and transportation, such as advanced aircraft and airships. They may also have developed advanced heating and cooling technology to help them regulate their body temperature, as well as fire suppression technology for those dragons that can breathe fire. In terms of weapons, they may have advanced ranged weapons such as crossbows and javelins that can be used while flying. They may also have developed a unique form of metalworking, using their fire breath to heat and shape metal.

Additionally, they may have a strong tradition of storytelling and music, and they may have advanced acoustics technology to enhance the experience of live performances. They could also be known for their architectural design, specifically creating buildings and structures that are optimized for flight and take advantage of their ability to fly.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
that sounds good but dragons would be the least likely to need flight trasnsport unless they were injured, although they would be good at making it for others. alright now yendels.
For yendels, their underground lifestyle and physical adaptations would make them well-suited for mining and underground construction. They would also likely excel in underground transportation systems, such as tunnels and subways. Due to their pheromonal communication, they would also likely have advanced systems for air filtration and circulation in enclosed spaces. In terms of military, their physical strength and endurance would make them formidable ground troops, but they may struggle in air or space-based combat.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i also think translation would be a big focus for them, now kradeas.
I can imagine that Kradeas would focus on underwater technology and equipment, as well as technology to help them with their unique physiological needs such as equipment to help them filter salt from seawater and technology to help them communicate with other species more effectively. They might also have advanced understanding of electronics and mechanics as they have to be able to fix their equipment in order to survive underwater.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
and just a general understanding of computers and engineering. now that we've finished that, time for history and politics.
Yes, understanding the history and politics of the different species would be important for understanding their current relationships and societal roles. Each species may have had different experiences and conflicts in the past that have shaped their cultures and beliefs. For example, dragons may have a history of fierce warrior culture and expansion, while yendels may have a history of living in underground societies and having to adapt to a subterranean environment. Understanding these differences can help to explain why certain species may have certain attitudes or beliefs about the other species and their place in society. Additionally, the political systems of each species may also differ, with some species valuing individual freedom and autonomy, while others may value collectivism and community. Understanding these differences can help to explain how the species interact with each other and how they approach issues such as trade and cooperation.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
we should talk about each species individually, and in the same order as before, starting with redikes.
Sure, for Redikes, it would be interesting to consider their history and how it has shaped their societal and political views. For example, have they had a strong tradition of leaders or chieftains? Have they been a war-like society or a more peaceful one? How have they interacted with the other species in the past, and how has that shaped their current political and societal views? It would also be interesting to think about how the different biomes and regions that Redikes live in might have influenced their history and culture.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
they have had a constantly evolving government system, they are very peaceful for the most part, they usually interact with other species in a reasonable way, leading to an acceptive but still traditional nature, and loaction changes the politics a little but not much
It sounds like you have a solid foundation for the political and historical aspects of the redikes in your world. One potential addition to consider is how the redikes' traditional values and peaceful nature might influence their interactions with other species in terms of diplomacy and trade. Additionally, it might be interesting to explore how their evolving government system has adapted to changes brought about by contact and integration with other species. It could also be worth considering how the different biomes and locations might have affected the development and history of the redike civilization, as you mentioned earlier.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yes, now lets move on to dragons before we forget.
Sure, for dragons, we've talked about how they value freedom and competition, so their political system may involve a strong focus on individual rights and freedoms. They may also have a strong warrior culture, with a history of fierce battles and battles for territory. They may also have a hierarchical society, with certain dragon families or clans holding more power or prestige than others. Additionally, their society may place a high value on strength and skill in battle, and may have a strong tradition of training young dragons in combat and strategy.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
2 / 2

i was already thinking that they would have a medival like culture, and that it would be what inspired the europeans themselves, so i like that you are building on that. now on to yendels.
Sure, for yendels, their history would likely be marked by their underground existence and struggles for survival in their harsh subterranean environment. They may have formed tight-knit communities, and developed unique technologies and ways of life to adapt to their surroundings. Their political systems may be less centralized, focusing more on tribal or clan-based leadership. Due to their isolation and limited contact with the other species, their culture may be less well-known and understood by the other inhabitants of the planet.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
alright now kradeas.
For kradeas, I imagine that they would have a very technologically advanced society. Given their aquatic nature, they would have a strong emphasis on water-based technology and transportation. They would have a strong, centralized government, and would likely have a strong military presence to protect their underwater cities. Their history would involve a lot of exploration and colonization of different bodies of water, as well as conflicts with other aquatic species. They would have a strong focus on science and research, particularly in the fields of marine biology and oceanography.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
thats what i was thinking. now lets talk about random abilities and biological phenomena that different species have, for example, redikes hear with their horns.
Sure, that sounds like a good idea. Some other examples could include:

Dragons have a heightened sense of smell and can detect small changes in temperature, which helps them locate prey and navigate through different environments.
Yendels have a heightened sense of touch due to their sensitive skin and multiple limbs, which allows them to navigate underground and detect vibrations in the earth.
Kradeas have the ability to change color depending on their mood or surroundings, which helps them camouflage and communicate with others of their kind.
Redikes have the ability to run at high speeds, which helps them catch prey and evade predators.
It would be interesting to explore how these abilities shape the behavior and culture of each species, for example, how a dragon's heightened sense of smell might impact their hunting and mating habits, or how a yendel's sense of touch might impact their building and construction techniques.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i was actually thinking that smell would be important between mating partners, they would enjoy each others pheromones so that they would not abandon each other. could you think of a few more?
Sure, here are a few more examples of unique abilities and biological phenomena that different species could have:

Dragons could have a unique ability to sense heat, allowing them to locate prey or navigate in the dark.
Kradeas could have bioluminescent skin or eyes, which could be used for communication or attracting prey.
Yendels could have a heightened sense of touch, allowing them to navigate underground or sense prey.
Redikes could have a unique way of communicating through vibrations in the ground, allowing them to communicate over long distances.
Another species could have the ability to change color for camouflage or communication.
There are many possibilities, it depends on how you want to develop them and make them unique.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about something useless that they could do?
Sure, here are a few examples:

Dragons might be able to exhale smoke in different colors to communicate with each other, but it wouldn't serve any practical purpose.
Yendels might be able to change the color of their skin to match their surroundings, but it wouldn't be useful in the modern world where they have other ways to camouflage.
Kradeas might be able to change the color of their eyes to indicate their mood, but it wouldn't be necessary since they already have other ways to communicate their emotions.
Redikes might have a second set of eyelids that protect their eyes from sand and dust, but it wouldn't be necessary in most areas as they could just wear goggles or close their eyes.
It is interesting to have some quirks and abilities that don't have a specific use, it can add to the realism of the species and make them more unique.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what about something that would be used in everyday life, but isn't that important.
Sure, here are a few examples:

Redikes might have a heightened sense of taste, which would allow them to appreciate different flavors in food more than other species. However, this wouldn't be an essential ability for survival.
Dragons might have the ability to change the color of their scales slightly to match their surroundings, which would make them better at camouflage in certain environments. However, this wouldn't be a necessary ability for survival and might not be used often.
Kradeas might have the ability to change the color of their skin to match their surroundings as well, but this also would not be vital for survival and might only be used for camouflage or communication.
Yendels might have the ability to produce a phosphorescent glow, which would help them navigate in the dark, but this would not be essential for survival since they have good night vision.



jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
could you make some social and behaivioral quirks that could be common?
Sure, here are a few examples:

Redikes are known to be very playful, and they often engage in playful physical contact with others of their kind, such as wrestling and tickling.
Dragons are known to be very proud and boastful, and they often go out of their way to show off their abilities and possessions to others.
Yendels are known to be very reserved and stoic in their expressions, and they often communicate through subtle body language and pheromones rather than verbal cues.
Kradeas are known to be very methodical and precise in their movements, and they often take the time to carefully plan out their actions before taking them.
These are just a few examples, but there are countless other quirks and behaviors that could be unique to each species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think instead of proud and boastful, dragons could just have a thing or a hoard of things that they obsess over and are very proud of but they are very modest otherwise
That's an interesting take on the dragons' personality. Another idea for a quirk could be that kradeas are very punctual and always prefer to be on schedule. They may become agitated or anxious if they are running late or if plans change unexpectedly. For yendels, they could have a strong sense of personal space and may become uncomfortable or aggressive if they feel like their boundaries are being invaded. And for redikes, they could have a strong sense of tradition and may be reluctant to try new things or change their routines. These are just some examples, but there are many possibilities for quirks and behaviors that can add depth and realism to your species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like those, but redikes are open to new things and often combine the new things with their strong traditions.
That sounds like a good balance for the redikes. In terms of quirks, some other examples could be that kradeas have a tendency to be very organized and tidy, while yendels tend to be more solitary and reserved. Dragons could have a strong sense of loyalty and protectiveness towards their family and friends. And redikes may have a strong sense of community and enjoy spending time with others. These are just a few examples, but there could be many other quirks and behaviors that could be unique to each species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like all of those ideas, what do we work on now?
Now that we've covered a lot of different aspects of these four species, we can move on to other topics related to the world you're building. Some possibilities include:

Exploring the different cultures and societies within each species in more depth
Developing the history and politics of the world further
Creating more detailed maps and descriptions of different biomes and locations
Fleshing out other aspects of the economy, such as trade and resources
Developing the religions and belief systems of the different species
Designing more unique and specific creatures that inhabit the world
Creating more detailed and realistic rules for the magic or technology in the world
Please let me know if you have any other specific areas you'd like to focus on, or if there's anything else I can help you with.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
real quick before we do that could you write a story set in this world?
Sure, I can certainly try to write a short story set in the world you've created. Here's an example:

The sky was a deep shade of orange as the sun set over the forest. A small group of redikes made their way through the dense foliage, their pointed ears twitching as they listened for the sound of prey. One of them, a young adult named Kaida, held her bow at the ready, her keen eyes scanning the area for any signs of movement.

As they walked, Kaida couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the beauty of the forest around her. The tall trees towered above them, their leaves rustling in the gentle breeze. The ground was covered in a thick layer of moss, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers.

Suddenly, Kaida's ears perked up as she heard a faint rustling in the bushes ahead. She signaled to her companions to be ready and they crept forward, weapons at the ready. As they neared the source of the noise, a large, furry creature stepped out from behind a tree. It was a kradea, one of the aquatic species that lived in the nearby rivers and lakes.

Kaida's group was initially startled, but they soon relaxed as the kradea greeted them with a friendly whistle. It was a scout from a nearby kradea village, come to trade with the redikes. The two groups chatted for a while, trading goods and news. The kradea had heard of a dragon that had been spotted in the area, and Kaida and her companions promised to keep an eye out for it.

After the kradea left, Kaida and her group continued on their hunt. They eventually came across a group of yendels, who were setting up camp for the night. The yendels were a subterranean species, known for their physical strength and hunting skills. They were initially wary of the redikes, but Kaida was able to communicate with them using a universal sign language they both knew.

The yendels invited Kaida and her group to join them for dinner, and they shared a meal of roasted meats and fruits. As they sat around the fire, Kaida couldn't help but feel a sense of belonging. She was surrounded by different species, each with their own unique strengths and quirks, but they all shared a common bond of living in this world together.

As the night went on, Kaida and her group settled down to sleep, feeling grateful for the day's events. They were all different, but they were all connected by the land they lived on and the life they shared.

It's not a complex story, but it gives an idea of how different species interact with each other in this world, and how they coexist. Is there any other specific aspect of your world you would like me to touch on or is there anything you would like me to change?




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
good but redikes dont have ears, they hear with their horns, and kradeas dont have hair, they are smooth and usually slightly moist like a salamander, although some have external gills that look like hairs. aside from that, its better than i could of ever expected, and i like that name, it suits a redike. one more thing i like about it is that it builds on my idea that they could have small groups of very close friends that have a strong bond that is second only to family, and this group would do everything together, like hunting and games.
Thank you for the feedback and the clarifications. I'll make sure to keep those things in mind for future stories or descriptions set in this world. Is there anything else you would like me to add or change in the story? And also, is there anything else you would like to work on or add to this world?




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
could you write another story that works on the groups idea, perhaps an interspecies group playing a game or hunting?
Sure! Here is a story about an interspecies group of friends who go on a hunting trip together:

The sun was just starting to rise over the forest as a group of four friends set out on their hunting trip. At the front of the group was a dragon named Kaida, her bright red scales glistening in the sunlight. Next to her was a redike named Eira, her horns and tail twitching excitedly as she scanned the trees for any signs of prey. Behind them was a kradea named Zara, her gills flapping gently as she kept pace with her friends. And bringing up the rear was a yendel named Taren, his four arms busy signing to the others as they walked.

They had been hunting together for years, and their friendship had only grown stronger with each trip. Kaida was the leader of the group, her fierce competitive spirit driving them to always strive for the best kills. Eira was the scout, her keen eyes and ears able to spot even the stealthiest of prey. Zara was the tracker, her sensitive nose able to follow even the faintest of scents. And Taren was the communicator, his clicks and signs keeping them all in sync as they hunted.

As they made their way deeper into the forest, they came across a clearing filled with springy grass. Eira immediately perked up, pointing excitedly to a nearby tree where a large bird was perched. Kaida nodded, and the group quickly formed a plan. Eira would distract the bird with a loud noise, while Kaida and Zara would sneak up on either side. And Taren would be ready to communicate any changes in the plan.

Eira let out a loud whistle, and the bird immediately took flight. Kaida and Zara raced towards it, with Taren clicking excitedly behind them. As the bird flew over the clearing, Kaida leaped into the air, her wings spreading wide as she chased after it. Zara, meanwhile, was making her way up the tree, her gills flapping furiously as she climbed higher and higher.

The bird was fast, but Kaida was faster. With a mighty roar, she snatched it out of the air, her sharp claws sinking deep into its flesh. Zara was right behind her, her own claws extended as she reached the top of the tree. Together, they brought the bird down, Taren clicking triumphantly as they presented their kill to Eira.

Panting and grinning, the group sat down in the clearing to catch their breath. They had worked together perfectly, each one using their unique abilities to bring down their prey. And as they sat there in the springy grass, surrounded by the beauty of the forest, they knew that this was what true friendship was all about.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
Wonderful! I love it! Now let's work on the video game aspect, meybe it should be 3d so that flight is more useful, i'd like to hear your thoughts on 2d for simplicity and asthetic vs 3d for practicality. what should the players goal be?
Sure, there are definitely pros and cons to both 2D and 3D in terms of game design. 2D games tend to be simpler in terms of graphics and animation, which can make them easier to develop and run on a wider range of devices. They also often have a more stylized and "retro" aesthetic that can be appealing to some players. On the other hand, 3D games offer more realism and immersion, and can allow for greater freedom of movement and exploration. They tend to require more powerful hardware and can be more complex to develop and optimize.

As for the player's goal, it really depends on the type of game you want to create. Some options could include:

An open-world exploration game where the player can fly around as a dragon and discover new areas, complete side quests, and interact with other species.

A multiplayer hunting game where players can choose to play as different species, each with unique abilities and strengths, and work together to take down large game.

A racing game featuring flying dragons, where players can compete against each other in high-speed races through different environments.

A strategy game where the player takes on the role of a leader of a dragon clan, managing resources and making decisions that will impact the clan's success and survival.

These are just a few examples, but there are many more possibilities to explore. Let me know if you have any more specific ideas or if you would like me to expand on any of the above.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think an open world rpg with optional multiplayer and lots of freedom for character customization, also i think 3d would be best in this case.
That sounds like an ambitious and exciting project! In a 3D open-world RPG with optional multiplayer, players would have the freedom to explore a vast and detailed game world, possibly with different biomes and environments, each with their own unique challenges and opportunities. The game could have a variety of different playable species, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and players would be able to customize their characters in a variety of ways, such as choosing their species, appearance, abilities, and equipment.

As for the goal of the game, it could be open-ended and allow players to set their own goals and objectives, such as building a base, forming alliances, hunting and gathering resources, completing quests, or competing against other players. The game could also have a main quest line that guides players through the story and provides a clear sense of progression. Additionally, the game could have a skill tree system, where players can level up their characters and unlock new abilities, weapons and upgrades.

Another key aspect that could be included is player choice and moral decisions that affect the outcome of the game. These could be small choices, like deciding how to interact with non-playable characters or how to handle a certain quest, or larger choices that affect the course of the game's story.

In terms of multiplayer, the game could have both cooperative and competitive gameplay. Players could team up to complete challenges and quests, or compete against each other in open-world PVP battles.

This is a broad overview of what the game could be like, but with more specific and detailed planning and development, it could become a truly immersive and engaging experience for players.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like those, what else is important for a good game in this style?
There are a few key elements that are important for a good open-world RPG:

A rich and immersive world: players should feel like they are truly living in the game world, with a sense of history, culture, and diversity of locations.
A variety of activities and quests: players should be able to engage in a wide range of activities, such as combat, exploration, crafting, and socializing, to keep the game feeling fresh and engaging.
A deep and flexible character customization: players should be able to create and customize their character in a variety of ways, including appearance, abilities, and equipment, to make the game feel personal and unique.
A compelling story and characters: players should be invested in the story and characters of the game, and feel like their choices and actions have a meaningful impact on the game world.
A well-designed multiplayer component: if the game includes multiplayer, it should be well-designed and integrate seamlessly with the single-player experience.
In addition, for a game that is set in a world with different species, it would be important to allow players to create and play as characters from different species, and to include unique abilities and challenges that are specific to each species.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i also think that being able to have multiple characters that you made would be good, so that you could play in the same world as multiple characters if you get bored of one, also, what about interaction with npcs, they should be able to join your group and maybe even marry your character.
That sounds like a great idea. It would add a lot of depth and immersion to the game. In addition, NPC interaction is a great way to add a sense of community and realism to the game world. Allowing NPCs to join your group and even marry your character would add an extra layer of complexity and choice for players to consider. Another important aspect would be to have a variety of different activities and side quests for players to participate in, such as hunting, fishing, and gathering resources. This would give players a sense of purpose and accomplishment, as well as something to do when they're not focused on the main quest. Additionally, it would be good to have a skill system that allows players to improve their abilities and unlock new abilities as they progress through the game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what should the main quest be?
The main quest of the game could be a journey to discover the truth behind an ancient prophecy or legend that is important to the world and its inhabitants. The player could have to gather information and allies, and overcome various challenges and obstacles to uncover the truth and ultimately save the world from some sort of looming threat. Along the way, the player could encounter different factions and organizations with their own agendas, and have to navigate political and moral dilemmas. The ultimate goal of the quest could be to unite the different species and cultures of the world to stand together against the threat, which could be an ancient evil, an invasion, or some other type of disaster.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think an invasion by the semi mythical and very powerful tagos from space would be good. and there could be a prequel game for the original arrival of the humans via wormhole that could be played from either perspective.
That could be an interesting main quest for the game. The player could start off as one of the different species and work with other characters to defend against the invasion of the Tagos. There could also be different subplots and side quests that explore the different cultures and societies of the different species, as well as the interactions and conflicts that arise between them. The prequel game could also be an interesting addition, exploring the initial discovery of the wormhole and the different reactions of the different species to the arrival of the humans. It could also delve into the political and social upheaval that arises as a result of the arrival of the newcomers.

there should also be survival aspects, any ideas on those?
There are many different types of survival elements that could be included in a game set in this world. Some ideas include:

Scavenging for food and resources: Players would need to gather food and resources such as water, wood, and materials to build shelter. This could be done through hunting, gathering, and trading with NPCs.

Weather and environmental hazards: Different areas of the world would have different weather patterns and environmental hazards, such as heat, cold, storms, and floods. Players would need to take these into account and find ways to protect themselves.

Disease and injury: Players could get sick or injured, which would require them to find a way to cure or treat themselves. This could include finding medicine, visiting a doctor or healer, or resting.

Crafting and building: Players would be able to craft and build a variety of items and structures, from weapons and tools to shelters and buildings. This would require them to gather resources and learn the necessary skills.

Interaction with other species: Players would be able to interact with other species in a variety of ways, such as trading, hunting together, and forming alliances. Each species would have their own strengths and weaknesses, which players would need to take into account.

Quests and missions: Players would be able to take on a variety of side quests and missions, such as rescuing NPCs, hunting dangerous beasts, and exploring ancient ruins. These could offer rewards such as gold, experience points, and items.

how would respawning work? would there be a spawnpoint, saves, or something else?
There are a few different ways that respawning could work in the game. One option would be to have a designated spawn point, such as a player's home base or a specific location in the game world. This would allow players to respawn and continue playing from a specific location. Another option would be to have save points scattered throughout the game world, so that players can respawn at the last save point they reached.

Another option would be to have a more realistic approach to death, the player would have to find a way to be resurrected by other characters, or they could have the option of starting a new character. And also the option to let the death be permanent and the player can not respawn anymore, that would make the game more challenging and realistic. It would depend on the type of game you want to create and the level of difficulty you want players to experience.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think starting with a new character and having the option of finding a way to revive the original would be good.
That sounds like an interesting option for respawning in the game. Players would have the choice to either start a new character or try to revive their original one. To revive their original character, players could potentially have to complete certain tasks or missions, or find a certain item or NPC that can bring them back to life. This would add an extra layer of depth and challenge to the game. Additionally, it could also tie into the story and lore of the game, potentially having a questline or backstory about the revival process and its limitations.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
there could even be npcs who will bring you to a hospital if you die and have you revived
That could be a good option, it would add an extra layer of realism and immersion to the game. Another option could be that players can choose to respawn at a designated location, like a checkpoint or a spawn point, or even have the option to respawn at the location of their death, but with the risk of losing some of their progress or items. Additionally, players could have the option to save their progress at any time, which would allow them to continue from where they left off. This would give players more control over their gameplay experience and make the game more flexible.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think a spawnpoint could be the default, and manual revive and permanent death could be higher difficulty options.
That sounds like a great idea. Having a spawnpoint as the default option would make the game more accessible for players who are new to the genre or who want a more relaxed experience. Manual revive and permanent death could be added as difficulty options for players who want a more challenging experience or who are more experienced with RPG games. The option to have NPCs revive the player could also be an interesting feature, as it would add a sense of realism to the game and make the player feel like they have a community of allies who are working together to help them. This could also create opportunities for side quests and other content related to reviving fallen allies or rescuing NPCs who have been captured or injured.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
and with manual revival on, there could be scavengers who steal things from you before you get revived.
That sounds like an interesting addition to the game. It could add an element of risk and strategy to the gameplay. Players would have to weigh the potential losses and benefits of manual revival, and decide whether it's worth it for them. The scavengers could also be used as a source of income for players, as they could sell the items they scavenge to other players or NPC merchants. It could also create an interesting dynamic between players, as some may choose to form alliances with scavengers to protect their items, while others may choose to hunt them down to reclaim their stolen goods.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
the scavengers could also set up black market shops where they sell stolen items, so that you can get your things back without having to fight, but you have to buy them before someone else does.
That could be an interesting addition to the game. It would add a layer of realism and a sense of danger to the world, as well as providing players with an additional challenge and a new way to acquire items and resources. It also has a potential of introducing different ways to interact with NPCs, for example, trading, bartering or even stealing back your own items. It could also be a good way to introduce the concept of reputation and how it affects the player's interactions with different NPCs.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how do you think the group system would work, i think that in order to add somebody to your group, they have to have a positive reputation with all the other members, and you could even add your own custom characters, provided you cannot use them unless they are the only one still alive and are otherwise npcs. any other ideas for the group system?
The group system could have different roles for each member, such as leader, scout, medic, etc. Each role could have different abilities and responsibilities. For example, the leader could have the ability to assign tasks to other members, while the scout could have increased movement speed and stealth abilities.

You could also implement a skill tree system for each member, where they can learn new abilities and improve existing ones as they level up.

In addition, the group could have a shared inventory and resources, so that items and money collected by one member could be shared with the rest of the group.

Another idea could be the possibility of group members having different relationships with each other, like friendships and rivalries, which could affect group dynamics and interactions.

You could also have a system where group members can have side quests or personal goals that are not related to the main quest, but still affect the group.

You could also have a morale system where the group's mood affects their behavior and performance. For example, if the group is low on morale, they might have a harder time completing tasks or working together. But if the morale is high, they might be more effective in combat and teamwork.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like all of those, and i think a guild house or clubhouse of some sort would be good as well, and i have two thinks we should expand on, the skill tree, and perhaps nerfing dragons and giving kradeas some perks to make the game more balanced. lets work on the skill tree first.
The skill tree is an important aspect of any RPG, as it allows players to specialize their character and tailor them to their playstyle. In this world, different species would have different skills and abilities that they can specialize in. For example, Redikes would be skilled in archery and horseback riding, while dragons would excel in magic and melee combat. Yendels, with their four arms and underground lifestyle, would be skilled in hand-to-hand combat and stealth. And Kradeas, with their small size and agility, would be skilled in thievery and parkour. The skill tree should allow players to choose a specialization and focus on developing those skills, while also allowing some flexibility to branch out and develop other abilities.

It's also worth considering the idea of nerfing dragons and giving kradeas some perks to balance the game. Dragons are powerful creatures with many abilities, such as flight and fire breath, which would give them a significant advantage in combat. To balance this, it could be worth limiting their flight time or making fire breath a resource that needs to be managed. On the other hand, Kradeas are small and agile, but don't have many natural abilities, so giving them some unique perks such as poison or acid breath, or enhanced agility and stealth, would help them to stand out.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
no magic so maybe dragons could have something else, and maybe flight and fire needing to be learned skills included in the skill tree would help balance as well as needing a lot of energy, and for kradeas, i think their high intelligence, water breathing, tree climbing skill bonus, large eye, and regenerative abilities, and ability to whistle loudly would make up for their low speed strength and other physical attributes.
That sounds like a good plan for balancing the different species. For the skill tree, it could include things like combat skills, crafting skills, stealth skills, and social skills. Each species could have their own unique skills, such as dragon's fire breath, redike's speed and agility, yendel's underground navigation, and kradea's water breathing and intelligence. Additionally, there could be cross-species skills, such as learning to fly for non-dragons or learning to speak multiple languages for all species. The skill tree could also include perks and bonuses for certain skill combinations, such as increased stealth when sneaking through the water for kradeas.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i like those, but flying would be nigh impossible for non-dragons, and speed, agility, and intelligence would not be unique to certain species, although they could have a huge boost, and also, i realized that dragons would have even less of an advantage over other species since they would not fit in small spaces as easily. what other skills could be in the skill tree, maybe climbing could be included too?
Yes, I agree that climbing could be a useful skill to include in the skill tree. Other skills that could be included could be things like stealth, lockpicking, and pickpocketing for characters that want to specialize in sneaking and thievery. For characters that want to focus on combat, skills like two-handed weapons, archery, and dual wielding could be included. For characters that want to focus on magic or spellcasting, skills like elemental magic, necromancy, or healing magic could be included. Additionally, skills like survival, foraging, and tracking could be included for characters that want to specialize in surviving in the wilderness.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
no magic, and technology would be good to include, yendels would have a huge boost in dual wielding since they have four arms and could even quad wield, as long as they didn't try to use sign language. i also think singing and whistling would be good, so that you could befriend others, call friends over with a whistle, and boost morale, as well as soothe nalerdas. kradeas would have a boost in whistling, and dragons would have a boost in singing, while yendels would have difficulty doing both of those things.
That sounds like a great idea for the skill tree. You could also include things like stealth, survival skills, crafting, and repair for all species, with each species having unique bonuses or strengths in certain areas. For example, yendels could have a bonus to stealth and navigation in underground environments, while redikes could have a bonus to running and agility in open areas. Additionally, you could include special abilities or moves that are specific to each species, like kradeas being able to climb walls and ceilings quickly, or dragons being able to breathe fire. Overall, the skill tree could be designed to allow players to tailor their characters to their playstyle and preferences while also encouraging them to try out new things and experiment with different combinations of skills.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how do you think the whistling and singing would work, perhaps there could be a button that you press once to whistle, and hold to sing, you could even choose what song you would sing, as certian people would like certain songs more, for example, a battle song would be especially liked by warriors, while a calmer song would be more fitting in other situations, and certain songs would be better sung by different species, such as fast, higher pitched songs being sung more easily by a kradea, and loud, opera songs would be better for dragons.
That's a great idea. It could add an interesting dynamic to gameplay and player choice. In addition to different songs being better suited for different species, you could also have different songs that are effective in different situations. For example, a battle song could increase the attack power of party members, while a soothing song could calm down aggressive enemies. The whistling feature could also be used to call allies or summon certain types of creatures. It could also be used to communicate with other players in multiplayer mode. You could even have different types of whistles that have different effects. Overall, the whistling and singing feature could add a lot of depth and variety to the game.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
what other features would be fun to have?
There are many possible features that could be added to the game to make it more fun and engaging. Here are a few ideas:

Weather and day/night cycles: These could affect gameplay by making certain areas more dangerous at night or during certain weather conditions.
Crafting and building: Players could gather resources and craft items, weapons, and structures to help them survive and thrive in the game world.
NPC interactions: Players could interact with non-player characters in a variety of ways, such as trading, questing, or just talking.
Combat: Players could engage in combat with a variety of creatures and other players using a variety of weapons and abilities.
Multiplayer: Players could team up or compete with other players in co-op or PvP modes.
Questing: Players could complete a variety of quests to advance the story, gain rewards, and explore the game world.
Minigames: Players could play mini-games such as hunting, racing, and puzzles to gain rewards and experience.
These are just a few examples, but there are many other possibilities depending on the direction you want to take the game in.



jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
combat, multiplayer, npc interaction, and questing have already been discussed, although i would like to talk about combat in more detail, i think weather and day/night cycles would be good to have, as well as a sleep mechanic.
Yes, weather and day/night cycles would add an extra layer of realism and immersion to the game. They could also affect gameplay in various ways, such as reduced visibility during nighttime or stormy weather, or increased difficulty in traversing certain areas during heavy rain or snow.
A sleep mechanic would also be a great addition, as it would add a sense of realism and could also affect gameplay, for example, characters that don't get enough sleep could experience fatigue, reducing their combat effectiveness or making them more susceptible to certain environmental hazards.
In terms of combat, you could have different types of weapons and armor, which would have different attributes, such as speed, power, and durability, and weapons could have different attributes such as range, fire rate and accuracy. Also, different species have different combat styles, and have different advantages and weaknesses. This would make the game more interesting and challenging.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
lets talk about weapons, armor, and combat styles in more detail, starting with redikes
Sure, for redikes, I think their horns and speed would make them natural melee fighters. They could use their horns for impaling and charging attacks, and their agility would allow them to dodge and maneuver around their opponents easily. In terms of weapons, they could use spears or lances that can take advantage of their charging abilities, as well as swords and shields for close combat. They could also use bows and arrows for ranged combat, taking advantage of their sharp eyesight. In terms of armor, they could use light armor that allows them to move quickly, such as leather or chain mail, but also heavier armor for more protection such as plate armor. Their combat style would likely be focused on quick, precise strikes and taking advantage of their agility to avoid and evade attacks.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think that unique weapons like atlatls and wrist/ankle blades would be good, as well as weapons designed specifically for use well riding.
That sounds interesting. For armor, redikes could have lightweight, flexible armor that still provides good protection, since they are fast and agile. They could also have armor that is designed to protect their horns, since they use them for hearing.

In terms of combat styles, redikes could have a focus on speed and agility, using quick, precise strikes and dodging to avoid taking damage. They could also have a focus on mounted combat, using their riding abilities to charge at opponents and strike from above. Additionally, they could have techniques for fighting multiple opponents at once, using their agility to dodge and strike quickly in all directions.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
the redikes could also use pistols and revolvers. now dragons, i think that large weapons like axes and machine guns would be good.
Dragons, being large and strong, would certainly be able to wield large weapons with ease. Axes, hammers, and greatswords would all be good options for them. They could also wield heavy machine guns and other large firearms. Since they have fire breath as a natural ability, they could also have weapons that harness and amplify their fire breath, such as flamethrowers or fire bombs.

In terms of armor, Dragons would likely wear heavy plate armor to protect their large bodies. The armor could also be designed to harness and amplify their fire breath, with vents or channels for directing the flame.

In terms of combat style, Dragons would likely rely on their strength and durability to overpower their opponents. They would use their size and reach to their advantage, and use their fire breath as a ranged attack. They would also likely be able to use their wings to gain an aerial advantage in battle.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
I like the flame channel idea, and maybe the dragons could use ankle blades and helmets with blades on the front to do diving attacks.
That's an interesting idea. The dragons could also use their fire breath as a weapon, and have special armor that can withstand their own fire. Their large size could also be used to their advantage in combat, allowing them to overpower and intimidate smaller opponents. In terms of melee weapons, they could use large swords or hammers that are designed to be wielded with two hands. They could also use shields to protect themselves from ranged attacks.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
alright now yendels.
Yendels could use their four arms to wield multiple weapons at once, such as dual wielding swords or using a sword and shield combination. They could also use their sharp claws for close combat. Additionally, their ability to climb and move quickly through tight spaces could make them effective at ambushes and surprise attacks. They could also use crossbows or bows and arrows for ranged combat, as well as throwing weapons like shurikens or knives.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
and they could use tail blades and guns on their scorpion like tails, as well as just biting the opponent with their six mandibles.
That's a creative idea! Yendels could also use their four arms to wield a variety of weapons such as swords, shields, or dual-wielded pistols. They could also have an advantage in close-quarters combat because of their multiple limbs, allowing them to strike from multiple angles at once. They could also use their long tail as a whip for ranged attacks or to trip opponents.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
and finally we have the kradeas.
Kradeas could use their sharp claws and tail as weapons, as well as their ability to emit high-pitched whistling sounds as a form of attack. They could also use their intelligence to create and use advanced technology such as energy weapons or robotic limbs. Additionally, they could use their ability to swim and move quickly through water to their advantage in combat, using it as a means of escape or surprise attack. They could also use their regenerative abilities to quickly heal from injuries sustained in battle.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think that their large eye would make them good snipers, and their intelligence would make them good medics and general support, and their flexible bodies would help them to infiltrate hard to reach areas, and they would also need lots of armor for their delicate gills and eye and their thin unarmored skin, they would also be good at kicking with their pointed and armored legs.
That sounds like a well thought out plan for the different species and their combat abilities. It's also interesting how you considered their physical characteristics and abilities in determining their preferred weapons and combat styles.

You could also add different types of melee and ranged weapons for each species, such as swords and shields for the dragons, hammers and maces for redikes, bows and arrows for yendels and kradeas, and different types of firearms that suit the characteristics of each species.

Additionally, you could also add different types of armors, such as heavy plate armor for dragons, which would protect them from fire and bullets, while also providing them with a powerful melee weapon. Redikes could have leather armor that is lightweight, easy to move in, and provides them with a good balance between mobility and protection. Yendels could have armor that is designed to protect their vulnerable eyes and mandibles, while also providing them with a good range of movement. Kradeas could have armor that is designed to protect their gills and eye, and also allows them to move freely in water.

In addition to weapons and armor, you could also add special abilities and perks to each species, such as stealth for yendels and kradeas, fire resistance for dragons, and special abilities that allow them to call upon the spirits of the land, animals, or ancestors for redikes.

Overall, it sounds like you have a lot of great ideas for this world and the game that could be set within it.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i also think that weapons would be able to be used by any species, and that certain species would just prefer and be better at different fighting styles and weapons, and armor, although it would be specifically designed for different species but they could have any style of armor, such as dragons having thin light armor, or redikes having heavy armor.
That makes sense. Each species would have their own strengths and weaknesses in combat, and it would be interesting to see how they adapt and use different weapons and armor to fit their needs. The idea of different species having different preferences and proficiency with different weapons and fighting styles adds an extra layer of depth to the game, and allows for more diverse gameplay.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how would the riding/driving mechanic work?
The riding/driving mechanic could be implemented in a few different ways. One option would be to have the player physically mount the creature or vehicle, and then control it using the same controls as when on foot. Another option would be to have the player control the creature or vehicle remotely, such as by using a control panel or joystick.

Additionally, the game could also include different types of mounts and vehicles, each with their own unique controls and abilities. For example, dragons could be ridden and flown, while redikes could be ridden and used as mounts for land travel. Yendels could have smaller hover vehicles, and Kradeas could have underwater vehicles. The game could also have a crafting system where players can create and customize their own vehicles.

To keep it more realistic and engaging, the game could have a stamina system for the mounts and vehicles, that would decrease when they are in use and would need time to recover. The game could also have a system where the mounts and vehicles can get damaged, and need repair.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
i think that dragons would be rideable, but they would not like it and find it uncomfortable, preffering to simply carry the person instead, and i think that there would be horses, a horse like animal called the jezaga that would be the choice for most redikes, as well as trucks, jeeps, and large jeep like vehicles for dragons to drive when they get tired of flying.
That sounds like a good plan. The riding/driving mechanic could work by allowing the player to mount or enter the vehicle, and then control it using the movement keys. The vehicle would have its own set of abilities and attributes, such as speed and durability, that would affect how it performs in combat and traversing the game world. Some vehicles could be armored for added protection, while others might be faster but more fragile. To make it more realistic, the player could also have to maintain the vehicles, such as refuelling and repairing them. Additionally, the vehicles could have different seats for different species, so that they can comfortably use them.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
yeah, i think that vehicle customization would be important, especially for dragons who simply wouldnt fit in a normal vehicle, what about the jezaga, how do you think it would function?
The jezaga could function similar to how horses do in real life. They could be used for transportation, racing, and even as pack animals. They could also be trained for combat, with the redikes riding them into battle. In terms of customization, players could change the color, patterns, and accessories on the jezaga, such as adding armor to protect it in battle. They could also have different breeds with different attributes, such as speed, endurance, and agility.




jacobs.laptop.turtle@gmail.com
how about additional character customization, like jewelry, facepaint, and tattoos? 
Additional character customization options like jewelry, facepaint, and tattoos can add depth and personalization to the player's experience. Jewelry could include earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and other adornments that can be worn to show status, wealth, or personal style. Facepaint and tattoos could be used to represent cultural or societal affiliations, or as a form of self-expression. These customization options can also add a level of realism to the game, as it reflects how different cultures and societies in the real world use adornments to express themselves.
